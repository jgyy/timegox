# Ascension of the Azure Cloud

A xianxia cultivation RPG built in **Godot 4**, played in **full 3D from a third-person view**, and **all art is generated from scripts**: every tree, building, character, monster and spell effect comes from code in this repository (GDScript, shaders and **Blender Python**), never from hand-made or downloaded files (see [Art pipeline](#art-pipeline)).
Play Lin Feng, an orphaned sect sweeper with a hidden "Nine Heavens root", from Qi Condensation to Myriad Daos as One, across **one open world in four realms**: a continent of 42 regions round Azure Cloud Mountain, ringed by the sea, with the **Nine Heavens** floating above it, the **Nine Springs** under it, joined by the Jianmu, the world tree, and now the **Isles of the Eastern Sea** out past the edge of its shelf, reached in Mazu's boat. It has 202 bosses, eighteen Heavenly Tribulations, eleven towns full of people and 84 buildings you can walk into, with 17 upper storeys and 13 cellars among them. Wake the **nine branches** of the Nine Heavens root, open the Founder's **sealed caves** as your realm allows, choose your road among **six Daos** and earn the trust of **eight peoples** of the realms.

> **Total gameplay duration: about 16 hours 3 minutes** (16:02:51 of game time for the end-to-end bot run, seed 1234), **1 hour 56 minutes more than the last release** (14:06:51). **The game is no longer a straight line, and its battles have to be earned.** 34 battles that carry the main story forward are now **trials**: harder than the bosses before them (up to twice the health, a quarter more attack, enraged when brought low) and closed to anyone unprepared, and every one can be passed in **three or four ways**: **by might** (a level, cultivation full at the peak of a realm, a tempered sword, the branches of the root), **by craft** (a talisman, lens, seal, ink or elixir made at Alchemist Mo's cauldron or Smith Tie's forge from the **essences** monsters leave behind and what the quests turn up: 29 recipes), **by wealth** (spirit stones), **by respect** (**renown**, earned from bosses, trials and **28 deeds** townsfolk ask of you), **by the Dao** you walk, **by the friendship** of a people, or **by a relic** found and kept; the way you take changes the battle and is remembered to the end. **Part XIII, "The Eight Gates", adds 49 minutes** and is non-linear: open **any four of eight gates in four realms, in any order**, each a trial of its own, and then reach the ending by **one of three roads** (the Sword, the Many Peoples or the Cauldron), each with its own requirements, battle and epilogue, up to a new realm, **Myriad Daos as One**. A new **Journal** (Esc > Journal) shows your renown, essences, treasures, the townsfolk's requests and every way through the trial ahead. And **the ending is new**: a short film of the wonders the story set right, each with its line of the epilogue, and then the results laid out beside Lin Feng and Yue Ling on a lotus over the clouds. And there are **810 things to do** in the world, each with an animation of its own: sit on a bench, drink from a well, strike a temple bell, play the qin, fish, swing, pray at a shrine, gather herbs, lift the training stones, sweep the leaves, read, stir a cauldron, work an anvil, weave, sleep in a bed.

- **The game is no longer a straight line: 34 trials, each with three or four ways through** (`scripts/trials.gd`, `Main.open_trial`). The battles that carry the main story forward are now **trials**: two lords in every chapter, three in the first, from the bandit chief Iron Fang to Xu Fu (25 bosses), the eight **Gate Generals** of Part XIII and **Chiyou** at the end. A trial's boss is **harder** than the bosses before it (1.3 to 2.0 times the health, 10 to 25% more attack, and *enraged* once it is brought below 35%), and **nobody unprepared may fight it**: walking up to it opens a choice screen with every way through, what each one needs (ticked off or not) and what it does in battle. Only a way whose needs are met can be taken. The ways:

  | Way | What it asks for | What it does in battle (typically) |
  |---|---|---|
  | **By might** | a cultivation level, **cultivation full at the peak of a realm**, a sword **tempered** so many times, so many **ranks of the Nine Heavens root** awake | nothing: you face it at full strength |
  | **By craft** | an item **made** at Alchemist Mo's cauldron or Smith Tie's forge (a talisman, a lens, a seal, an ink, a mirror, an elixir...) | the foe begins weaker, its devastating blows are blunted, or its weakness cuts deeper |
  | **By wealth** | **spirit stones**, paid (once: a lost battle does not charge again) | the foe begins weaker or strikes softer |
  | **By respect** | **renown**: the respect of the world | allies strike the foe every round and the party takes less harm |
  | **By the Dao** | **walking a Dao** (change at any Dao Stele), sometimes as an Adept or a Master | a weakness shown, the first blow, less harm |
  | **By friendship** | the **standing** of one of the peoples of the realms (Friend or Kin) | the people's warriors fight beside you |
  | **By a relic** | something **found** (a keepsake hidden upstairs or in a cellar, a boss's trophy), kept or given up | the foe weakens |

  The way taken is remembered: the battle log names it, the **Journal** lists every trial passed and how, the Annals keep it, and the **ending names the road you walked most** ("Lin Feng, Master of Cauldron and Forge", "Friend of the Four Realms", "the Unbending Sword"...).
- **Crafting from what monsters leave behind.** Every foe beaten in an ordinary battle may leave an **essence** of its element (40%; bosses always leave three): Wood, Fire, Water, Earth, Thunder, Yin and Metal Essence. Alchemist Mo and Smith Tie now **craft** from essences, the things found on the quests (Thunder Shards, Saint Relics, Jade Seals, Keys of the Gate of Heaven...) and spirit stones: **29 recipes**, each listed once the story reaches it, from Smoke-Pellets for Iron Fang (two Wood Essences and a Spirit Herb) to the Elixir of Coming Home for Chiyou (five essences of each of five elements, an autumn leaf from his own maples and 300,000 spirit stones). The shops show what each recipe needs and what it is for, and a row of your essences.
- **Respect has to be earned.** **Renown** grows with every boss (+2), every trial passed (+4) and every keepsake given to a people (+2), and with **28 deeds**: requests from townsfolk all over the world, from Auntie Zhou's pickling brine and Old Shen's cracked bell at the sect to Granny Wen's mulberries, the Yumin's cold egg-cellar and Landfall's first keel in two thousand years. A townsperson with a request asks it when you talk to them; bring what they want and they pay, and the world thinks better of you, through seven titles from *Unknown* to *Legendary*. Every respect path asks for more renown than the bosses and trials alone give, so it is the path of a player who helps people.
- **Wealth matters.** Spirit stones used to pile up past a million by the end with nothing to spend them on; the wealth paths (from 150 stones to bribe Iron Fang's lieutenants to 420,000 to buy back the Lost Fleet), the recipes and the deeds' rewards give them a use.
- **The Journal** (Esc > Journal): your renown and title, your essences and treasures, the townsfolk's requests (and which you can do now), the trial ahead with every way through and its needs ticked off, the Eight Gates during Part XIII, and the trials you have passed and how.
- **Part XIII, "The Eight Gates"**, adds 49 minutes of play (see [below](#part-xiii-the-eight-gates)) and is **non-linear**: after the briefing, Yinglong's account of Zhuolu and a hunt of the war god's war-band, **open any four of eight gates, in any order**, two in each of the four realms, each a trial of its own (one asks for a Dao, another for a people's friendship, another for wealth, renown, a crafted key, a relic or plain strength); every gate opened beyond four weakens the war god at the heart; carry the invitations to the Conclave to **any four of the eight peoples' leaders, in any order**; and then reach the end by **one of three roads**, each with its own requirements, its own battle and its own epilogue. A new realm, **Myriad Daos as One**, its tribulation, eight Gate Generals and Chiyou, five new monsters, two war-bands marching in every gate's region, and a new ending (below).
- **A new ending: the Ascension, as a short film** (`scripts/ending.gd`). The old results screen had piled thirteen chapters' finales into one frame around the hero (the pillars, Nuwa's rings, the Wheel, the Loom's threads, the bridge, the sun and the moon, the cauldrons, the Jianmu, the isles, the gates), under a camera six metres away, with a yellow lotus and lily pads filling the foreground, seven lines of epilogue printed straight over the brightest part of the sky and the results in a box over the characters' feet. Now every wonder the story set right has a place of its own on a sea of clouds at sunset and a **shot of its own, with its line of the epilogue as a subtitle** between letterbox bars: the magpie bridge over the Star River with the sun and the moon taking turns, the Nine Cauldrons with their river, the Jianmu (the crown the world builds in the Nine Heavens), the Isles of the Eastern Sea on their sleeping turtles, the Eight Gates standing open under the Jianmu, and the Wheel of the Six Paths between two of Nuwa's pillars with Lin Feng's parents walking up a road of light to it. Then the camera draws back from Lin Feng and Yue Ling on a lotus, the sun going down behind the gates, and **the results come up beside them**: the time, the realm and the Dao, the battles, renown and deeds, a bar of the ways taken through the trials, the name the climb earned (from the way taken most) and how the war god's story ended on the road chosen. Enter skips the film.
- **Things to do: 810 things in the world Lin Feng can use, on 18 new animations** (`scripts/props.gd`, `World.start_use`, `art/lib/person.py` INTERACT). Facing one, the hint names it ("Enter: Strike the bell"); Enter, and he steps up to it (or onto it, to sit), does it, steps back, and something comes of it. **Outdoors**, every region has things of its own beside the road, chosen by its theme (270 in all, 20 kinds): a stone bench, a well, a wayside shrine, a bronze bell and a great drum, a qin on a stone table, a fishing jetty and a fish pond, a swing, a wishing tree hung with red ribbons, an inscribed stele, spirit herbs, a campfire, training stones, a broom and a heap of leaves (he swept the sect's steps for three years; his hands still know how), a weiqi board, a tea table, a stone lion, wind chimes, a stone lantern. **Indoors**, every piece of furniture in every building, upstairs and in the cellars, can be used (540, 22 kinds): pray at the altars, bow to the founders' statues, meditate on the cushions, read at the bookshelves and desks, look at the calligraphy, drink tea at the tables and taste from the barrels, sit on the stools, stir the cauldrons, cook at the stoves, warm your hands at the hearths, work the anvils, practise a form at the weapon racks, weave at the looms, sleep in the beds, trim the lanterns.

  | | What he does | What he holds | How it answers | What comes of it |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | bench, swing, stool | sits (beside Yue Ling on a bench; on the swing, higher and higher) | | the swing goes | rest: health and qi |
  | well, tea, table, barrel | draws water or pours tea and drinks | a dipper, a cup | the bucket comes up | a drink: health |
  | shrine, altar, statue, cushion | lights incense and prays, bows, meditates (Yue Ling prays too) | | incense smoke | qi |
  | bell, drum | takes the hanging beam and strikes | | the bell swings and rings out | a line of lore |
  | qin, chimes, broom, loom, cauldron, koi | plays, sets them ringing, sweeps, weaves, stirs, feeds the fish | a broom, a ladle | notes, chimes, leaves, steam, the fish rise | qi |
  | fishing | fishes from the jetty | a rod | the float bobs and dips | a quiet hour: health and qi |
  | stele, bookshelf, desk, scroll, shelf, counter, lantern, nest, weiqi | lays a hand on it, reads, looks, studies the game | a book | the inscription glows; the lantern stays lit | a line of lore |
  | wishing tree, stone lion, cabinet | throws up a wish ribbon, rubs the lion's head, looks inside | | the ribbon flies up | a find: spirit stones (once) |
  | herbs | kneels and gathers | | sparkles | a Wood Essence (again after a while) |
  | training stones, anvil, weapon rack | lifts the stone lock overhead, works the anvil, practises | a stone lock, a hammer | dust, sparks | a little cultivation (again after a while) |
  | campfire, hearth, stove | warms his hands, cooks | a ladle | the fire flares, embers rise | rest |
  | bed | sits on the edge and nods off | | | sleep: everybody restored |

  Every thing has three things said of it, in turn; the first time Lin Feng does each kind of thing it is a new **pastime** (renown +1, "A new pastime: strike the bell (12 of 42)"). Yue Ling joins in or reacts: she sits beside him on a bench, sits on the bank while he fishes and beside the table while he plays, prays at the shrines, warms her hands at the fire, laughs when he lifts the stones. While he does something Enter or Esc stops him. Nothing stands in anyone's way: the things outdoors stand on the forest edge or in the water by the bank (in a little clearing of their own), and the furniture on the tiles it already filled (the walk-over pieces, a cushion or a stool, are used by facing them), so no road changes and the bot, which never uses them, plays the same game to the second.

  The **animations** are new Blender clips for the party (`art/lib/person.py` INTERACT, baked into Lin Feng and Yue Ling): sit on a bench, doze, drink, strike, read, play the qin, meditate, fish, pray, gather, warm the hands, stir, hammer, sweep, weave, lift, toss and touch, each starting and ending in the idle pose or holding a breathing loop, the clips that sit or crouch lowering the hips themselves. A swordsman's rig now has a **sword bone** in the right hand (Lin Feng and three others), so a clip that needs both hands puts the blade away; what he holds is built in code and hung on his hand bone while he needs it.

- **The bot** walks every kind of road: its plan takes the trials by every way there is (in the verified run: craft 9, respect 5, wealth 5, might 5, dao 4, relic 1, peoples 1), and it hunts essences, crafts at the cauldron and the forge, does deeds for renown, fetches keepsakes from upper storeys and cellars, changes Daos at the steles and opens the gates nearest first. The other two roads into the heart are verified with `--bot-start=s_p13_heart --route=sword|cauldron`. **16:02:51** for the whole game, **1 hour 56 minutes more than the last release**; CI now requires **15 hours**.
- **Code**: the game's GDScript grew from 26,632 to 31,264 lines (`scripts/trials.gd`, the trials, recipes, deeds and renown, and `scripts/props.gd`, the things to do, are new). Every new boss and monster is one of the existing script-built models in a palette of its own; five character exports were rebuilt from their scripts (Lin Feng and Yue Ling with the interaction clips, and the swordsmen with the sword bone).
- **Bugs found and fixed** (see [below](#bugs-found-and-fixed)).

### References

Background for this release (the Eight Gates, Chiyou and the war at Zhuolu):

- **Chiyou and the battle of Zhuolu**: the war god of the Nine Li, with bronze heads and iron brows, who made the first weapons of metal and fought the Yellow Emperor through a hundred days of fog; the Wind Earl and the Rain Master who fought for him, Nüba who dried the rain, the drum of Kui's hide whose beat broke his army, and the fetters struck off him that grew into the first maples, in the "Great Wilderness" chapters of the [*Classic of Mountains and Seas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) ([Chiyou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyou), [the battle of Zhuolu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zhuolu)); "Chiyou's Banner", the red vapour that rose from his tomb every autumn and later the name of a comet.
- **Xingtian**, the giant who fought on after the Yellow Emperor cut off his head, with eyes in his chest and a mouth in his belly ([Xingtian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xingtian)).
- **The Eight Gates**: Opening, Rest, Life, Harm, Closing, Sight, Alarm and Death of [Qimen Dunjia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qimen_Dunjia), taught to the Yellow Emperor by the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, laid on the eight trigrams ([Bagua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua)); the "Eight Gates Golden Lock" formation of the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, which falls when it is entered by the right gate.
- **Wang and Liang, Chi and Mei**: the goblins of the mountains, old things and waters that fought in Chiyou's host.

- **Cultivation levels matter a lot more** (`data.gd` `REALM_INFO`, `suppression`, `game.gd`, `battle.gd`, `main.gd`):
  - **Realm suppression**: a fighter a whole major realm above another strikes **20% harder** and is struck 20% softer, up to three realms (x1.6); it is announced as the battle opens ("Realm suppression: your Golden Core weighs on them"). It works both ways, so rushing a region under-cultivated hurts. Heavenly Tribulations are heaven itself and press on every realm alike.
  - **Aura**: a pack whose strongest beast is **two realms below** Lin Feng scatters as he walks into it rather than fight; it still counts as driven off for a hunt.
  - **The Founder's nine sealed caves**: Founder Qing Lian sealed a cave on Azure Cloud Mountain for each realm from Golden Core to Primordial Sovereign; a stone door opens only to a cultivator of the realm carved on it. Inside are her letters to the bearers who would come after her, the scratched notes of two bearers Xu Mo caught before they reached the next door, a gift of spirit stones and an **awakening of the root**. The Annals keep what is written in them.
  - **What a realm is**: the new **Cultivation** page (Esc > Cultivation) shows Lin Feng's realm, his lifespan (120 years at Qi Condensation, 100,000 as a True Immortal, then beyond counting), how the world addresses him (young friend, Daoist friend, senior, elder, Immortal, Sovereign, Venerable, Sage...) and what the realm is like from the inside.
  - **The world notices**: the first time a townsperson sees him after a breakthrough they say so, in six bands of awe; and **realm-gated lore**: fifteen people (the Elder, the Archivist, Old Wu, Granny Wen, the immortals...) tell a high enough cultivator things they tell nobody else (`Data.CHAT_DEEP`).
- **Cultivation talents matter a lot too: the nine branches of the Nine Heavens root** (`Data.TALENTS`, `Game.talent_*`):

  | Branch | Each rank (of three) | Crown (rank three) |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Sword Bone** | Sword Strike and physical techniques +22%, single-target techniques +6% | the first blow of every battle lands as a critical strike |
  | **Thunder Root** | thunder techniques +18% | a thunder technique on a weakness strikes again for half |
  | **Five-Phase Root** | fire, water, wood and earth techniques +12% | techniques that strike every foe cost a fifth less |
  | **Yin Root** | dark techniques +18% | a dark technique heals Lin Feng for a tenth of its harm |
  | **Vajra Body** | health +10%, harm taken -5% | once a battle, a fatal blow leaves him one breath |
  | **Sea of Qi** | qi +10%, +1% qi a turn, techniques 3% cheaper | once a battle, a third of his qi floods back when it runs low |
  | **Enlightened Mind** | meditation +12%, cultivation from battle +6% | every battle teaches the Dao he walks twice over |
  | **Heaven's Favour** | spirit stones +15%, critical strikes +3%, pills found +8% | a boss always leaves a third healing pill |
  | **Spirit Sense** | speed +2, slips 3% of blows; feels hidden caches | he moves first in every battle; foes miss more |

  - A branch wakes one rank at each **awakening**: when his qi first stirs (the Elder explains the root's nine branches), at **every tribulation** he survives and in **every Founder's cave** he opens, and he chooses which on a new choice screen; an unspent awakening waits on the Cultivation page.
  - **The world grows with the root**: every foe is a little tougher for each rank a cultivator of its level would be expected to have woken (`Data.expected_ranks`), so the branches a player wakes (and the caves they open) decide whether they keep pace; and a **Heavenly Tribulation tests a woken root harder** (+1.5% per rank awake, heaven's jealousy).
  - **Spirit Sense** reveals four caches hidden on the isles; the ending names the ranks awake.
- **Custom animations in the cutscenes**: every person in the game (153 Blender characters) has **ten new gesture clips** baked in `art/lib/person.py` (nod, shake, point, wave, laugh, grieve, think, kneel, offer, shock). A line of dialogue can name its gesture (`["Speaker", "text", "kneel"]`), a narrator's line can direct somebody present (`"Mazu, Who Brings the Boats Home:offer"`), and otherwise one is read from the words (`Data.emote_for`: thanks bow, refusals shake their heads, welcomes wave, directions point, questions think); the listener answers (a bow for a gift, a wave for a wave, a nod for grief). A **conversation camera** eases from the chase camera into a two-shot from the side at head height (higher indoors), drifts during narration and eases back. The ending screen has Yue Ling waving, bowing and laughing and Mazu waving from her boat.

- **More people in every town**: 22 new townsfolk with their own Blender models and three lines each: a new disciple and the herb-gardener at the sect; a former tax-clerk of the Court carrying noodles, the noodle-seller and a courier at Cloudfoot; the ox-herd and the schoolteacher at Qingshi; a lantern-maker and the archery-master at Yanggu; a star-glass blower and a Sogdian merchant at Shazhou; a scholar who failed the examinations nine times and a cormorant fisher at Longmen; a bell-tuner and the keeper of the casting pits at Tushan; a Yumin who cannot fly and a rain-clerk at Featherfall; a silk-diver and a fruit-trader of the Deathless at Tearwater; a roll-clerk and the lamplighter at Youdu; and a fox of one tail at the Gate of Heaven. Landfall adds twelve more.
- **A richer, more consistent world**: two new peoples (the **Thousand Children of Landfall**, mortals on the isle of the immortals for two thousand years, and the **Immortals of the Isles**) with their Daos, keepsakes and boons; **progress-aware chat** (`Data.CHAT_LATER`: people only speak of falling stars and Jade Emperors once those have happened); the Founder's caves and their letters; realm-gated lore; and **nineteen plot holes fixed** (see [below](#narrative-plot-holes-found-and-fixed)).
- **Part XII, "The Returning Ruins"** adds 1 hour 23 minutes (see [below](#part-xii-the-returning-ruins)), verified by the playthrough bot; CI now requires **12 hours**.
- **Code**: the game's GDScript grew from 23,697 to 25,537 lines and the Blender Python from 19,113 to 20,039 lines; all 219 assets (153 people, 40 monsters, 26 props) rebuild from their scripts.

```

- **More height above and an underworld below.** The land used to be the whole world. Now it is the middle of three (`scripts/atlas.gd`, `world.gd`, `terrain3d.gd`):
  - **Two new realms, each a world of its own**, built by the same atlas as the continent: regions round sites, organic borders under a domain warp, roads by A*, Lotus Seals where the chapter is not open yet. Where the continent's land runs out into the sea, theirs runs out into the sky or the dark.
  - **The Nine Heavens** float **96 m above the land**: Juntian, the Level Heaven, and Changhe, the Gate of Heaven, are islands with steep rock undersides over a sea of cloud that runs on to the horizon, under bright high air and a violet-and-gold dusk.
  - **The Nine Springs** lie **64 m below**: the cavern country under the roots and Youdu, the Dark Capital, on rock shelves over a faintly glowing abyss, lit by glowing moss, lanterns and the Torch Dragon's eye.
  - **The Jianmu**, the Standing Tree of the old myths, grows overnight on the open ground west of the sect: a trunk wider than the Hall that goes up through the clouds to a crown of leaf-clouds in Juntian, with roots that split the hillside and come out in the roof of the Nine Springs. The realms are laid out so that the crown stands right above its foot and the roots right below. **A stair winds up the trunk and another goes down the roots**; walking onto one carries Lin Feng up or down in a lift and a fade, and the world on the other side streams in around him.
  - The minimap and the HUD follow the realm you are in, and the **world map has a page for each realm** (Left/Right switches between them), with the Jianmu marked on each.
- **Multi-storey buildings and cellars to explore.** A building can have an **upper storey** (`upper`) and a **cellar** (`cellar`) in `Data.AREAS`, each a small world of its own (`Atlas._floor`) reached by a flight of **stairs** inside the building. Upstairs is a plank floor laid on the ground floor's walls, with walls, windows and furniture of its own and the roof raised a storey higher (`Architecture.house`); while Lin Feng is on the ground floor the storey lifts away with the roof, so you can still see him. A cellar is a room of dressed stone and timber posts lit by lanterns (`Architecture.cellar`), with dark, close air of its own (`Look.cellar_environment`). There are **23 floors** (12 up, 11 down), furnished with beds, shelves, barrels, altars, cushions, bookshelves, desks, nests and lanterns:
  - **The sect**: the Sealed Archive under the Scripture Library (where Archivist Lan kept everything the Court ordered forgotten), the ancestral crypt under the Hall and the upper dormitory.
  - **The old towns**: the letter room over Cloudfoot's post station and the upper gallery of the Teahouse of Ten Thousand Tales, Granny Wen's root cellar in Qingshi Village, the guest rooms of the Leaping Carp Inn and the harbourmaster's flood-record store in Longmen, and the wine cellar of the Inn of the Late Arrival in Tushan.
  - **Featherfall** (the top of the Aerie Tower, Yu Jian's feather loft, the warm cellar under the Egg-Nursery, the Archive of Rain under the Rain Ministry), **Changhe** (the moon terrace of the Pavilion of the Moon-Foxes, the Moon-Wine Shop's wine loft, the old gatehouse cellar), **Tearwater** (the pearl vault, the Tide-Singer's singing room, the loft under the Great Root) and **Youdu** (the magistrate's upper room, Zhi Ma's paper store, the deep hall of Sovereign Earth, the lodgings of the Inn of the Last Lantern).
  - Quest scenes happen upstairs and downstairs, and the **keepsakes the peoples love** are hidden on these floors.
- **Six Daos to choose from.** With the Court gone, so is its one road (obedience). When the Jianmu grows back the Elder asks which road Lin Feng will walk, on a new choice screen, and he can change roads at any **Dao Stele** (one stands in the sect's courtyard and one in each new region). Every Dao keeps its own **mastery**: battles won while walking it raise it from Novice to Adept to Master, and its passive grows with it. At **Adept** it teaches a technique of its own. The people he meets **answer the Dao he walks**: the Elder when he chooses, every people when they first meet him, Chong and Li after their fights, and the ending tells the story his way.

  | Dao | Motto | What it does (Novice, Adept, Master) | Technique from Adept | Honoured by |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **the Sword** | "A blade has one direction: forward." | single-target techniques x1.15 / 1.22 / 1.3, the plain sword strike x1.5 / 1.6 / 1.7 | Ten Thousand Swords Return to One | humans and the dragon-kin |
  | **Free Wandering** | "The Peng rises on a wind of ninety thousand li, and goes where it likes." | +3 / 5 / 7 speed, the party slips 7 / 10 / 14% of blows | Peng's Wind of Ninety Thousand Li | the Feathered Folk |
  | **the Compassionate Heart** | "Hold the sky only as long as you choose, and ask for help." | heals x1.2 / 1.3 / 1.4, Lin Feng heals 3 / 4 / 5% a turn, the party takes 4 / 6 / 8% less harm | Lotus Heart Sutra (heals and raises the party) | the Pearl-Weepers |
  | **Formations** | "The land keeps its shape because it is allowed to." | the party takes 12 / 16 / 20% less harm | Eight Trigrams Grand Array | the shades of Youdu |
  | **the Cauldron** | "Every pill is borrowed time. Borrow wisely, and for others." | pills x1.6 / 1.8 / 2.0, spirit stones x1.25 / 1.35 / 1.5, techniques cost 8 / 12 / 15% less qi | Nine-Turn Golden Elixir Fire | the Deathless |
  | **the Mirror** | "The moon in the water is still the moon." | foes miss 7 / 10 / 13% of the time, weaknesses cut x1.65 / 1.75 / 1.85 (normally x1.5) | Mirror-Flower, Water-Moon | the celestial foxes |

- **The peoples of the realms.** Six peoples live above and below the land, each with its own home, the Dao it honours, the keepsake it loves and a boon for a friend (`Data.RACES`). **Standing** with a people grows with the help Lin Feng gives in their lands (every quest step there, more for a boss) and by half as much again if he walks the Dao they honour; a **keepsake** given to any of their people adds more. At 50 they call him **Friend** and grant their boon; at 100, **Kin**. Their townsfolk speak to the Dao he walks now and then, and when he carries the keepsake their people love he can give it to them. The **Dao & Peoples** page in the pause menu shows it all.

  | People | Home | Honours | Loves | Boon as a friend |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **Yumin, the Feathered Folk** | Featherfall, in Juntian | Free Wandering | a wutong seed | Lin Feng acts sooner (+3 speed) |
  | **Dragon-kin of the Rain Ministry** | the Rain Ministry, in Juntian | the Sword | a night-shining pearl | Lin Feng hits harder (+6% attack) |
  | **Tianhu, the celestial foxes** | Changhe, the Gate of Heaven | the Mirror | peach-blossom wine | foes miss a little more often |
  | **Jiaoren, the Pearl-Weepers** | Tearwater, in the Nine Springs | the Compassionate Heart | a pressed moon lotus | every heal is 10% stronger |
  | **The Deathless** | the root-groves of the Nine Springs | the Cauldron | a pressed autumn leaf | Lin Feng is hardier (+8% health) |
  | **Shades of Youdu** | Youdu, the Dark Capital | Formations | ancestor incense | the party takes 6% less harm |

  - **19 new Blender-built characters** for them (`art/lib/race.py`, a new library hooked into `person.py`): **wings** of coverts over cubic-curve flight feathers that sway with the robe, a **crest** of plumes, **fox ears** with a cupped inner ear and fur tufts, **one to nine tails** fanned in two rows from under the sash, **fin ears** with rays and a pale edge, branching **dragon antlers**, **scales** on the cheekbones and the backs of the hands, and **whiskers** (barbels from the upper lip); the Deathless are black-skinned and the shades pale as paper. Among them: Ling Yu and Feather-Mother Yu Hua of the Feathered Folk, Rain-Minister Ao Run, Hu Qingyi the Ninth-Tail Matron, Pearl-Weaver Shui Lian, Elder Bu Si of the Deathless, Lantern-Magistrate Ming Yi and Houtu, Sovereign Earth.

- **The world map is no longer a grid.** The old world was 38 rectangles packed into nine east-west bands with a 60-tile mountain column down the west side: every region's open ground a rounded rectangle, every border a straight seam between rows, the coast a frame. Now (`scripts/atlas.gd`, `scripts/mapgen.gd`):
  - **Sites, not rows.** Every region has a site and a *way*, the direction its road runs through it, and its own map is turned to face that way. Each chapter winds outward from Azure Cloud Mountain as a province of its own: Part I east and up the east coast, Part II west along the north coast, Part IX east to the sunrise, Part V south-east, Part III south, Part VIII south-south-west, Part VII south-west, Part VI west, Part IV west and up into the sky, and Part X north to the river and the broken pillar.
  - **Organic borders.** A tile belongs to the region whose site is nearest, measured in that region's own half-sizes (an anisotropic, weighted Voronoi diagram), so long regions own long land, and the point is first moved by a two-scale domain warp, so borders wander like coasts and ridges. The land round everything that matters in a region (people, bosses, gates, buildings, monster packs) always belongs to it.
  - **A coast.** Land runs out about two half-sizes from the nearest site, so the continent has bays, capes, fjords between the mountain's spurs and an inner sea in the north-east. The sea is one surface for the whole world (sea tiles are cut out of every region's terrain) with foam along the coast, water carried under the coastal land, the ocean running on past the edge of the world and a seabed under it.
  - **Open ground with a shape.** A region's open ground is an ellipse filling its map, pushed and pulled into lobes and bays by a domain warp, bitten by a second noise and frayed at the edge, with forest beyond; clearings stay round everything that matters and trails join any that end up in the forest. A test checks that every region's corners are mostly forest.
  - **Roads that find their way.** Roads are searched for with A* across the land: old paths are cheap, open ground cheap, forest dear and water dearer, and a slow noise field makes them wind. Each road crosses from one region to the next exactly once, at the point of their border that makes the way shortest, and the Lotus Seal stands right there, turned across the road. Land bridges are raised along every road, so none has to cross the sea.
  - **Rivers, ponds and winding streets** inside regions (`river`, `ponds` and `roads` in `Data.AREAS`): a river runs through Longmen under the main street's bridge, a pond gives Shazhou its oasis, and towns and dykes get curved streets drawn as splines.
  - The **world map** is a full-screen page now: one sea colour with paler shallows, every region's name at its site (a town at a region's heart names it), towns marked in gold, closed seals in red, and beside the map the history of the region Lin Feng is standing in.
- **Four new towns and a deeper world.**
  - **Cloudfoot**, the post town at the foot of the mountain where the north road leaves for the river: a post station, Cartographer Pei's House of Maps, the Teahouse of Ten Thousand Tales, the Caravanserai of the Four Roads, a shrine to Xiu, god of roads, and the post stables.
  - **Longmen**, the ferry town below the Dragon Gate: the Leaping Carp Inn, the Temple of the River Earl with its flood stele, a boatyard, the fish market, the lock-keeper's house, a teahouse on stilts and the harbourmaster's office, on a river with a bridge.
  - **Tushan**, the cauldron-casters' town on Mount Kuaiji: the Hall of the Nine Cauldrons, Tu Lan's foundry, the bell works, the stone-carver's workshop, the Inn of the Late Arrival and the charcoal-burner's lodge, round a great bronze cauldron.
  - **Shazhou Oasis**, a caravan town round a sweet well in the Desert of Fallen Stars: a caravanserai, the Sweet Well, the Temple of the Fallen Stars and the camel yard.
  - **26 new people, all Blender-built** with their own props and three things each to say, and those things tie the world together: the postmaster knows who writes to whom between the towns, the caravan master's camels know every road from the desert to the Silk Woods, the stone-carver cuts the flood marks for Longmen's stele.
  - **A history for every region and town** (`Data.REGION_LORE`, `Data.TOWNS`): where it lies, who lives there and what happened there. It is shown beside the world map, and the new **Annals** page in the pause menu keeps every place Lin Feng has been.
  - **Part X tells why the map changed**: the Heavenly Court had surveyed the land into squares and pinned it with Yu the Great's Nine Cauldrons; with the Court gone the land is lying down in its own shape again.
- **Part X, "The Nine Cauldrons"** added 1 hour 14 minutes (see [below](#part-x-the-nine-cauldrons)), verified by the playthrough bot; CI then required **10 hours**.
- **Bugs found and fixed** (see [below](#bugs-found-and-fixed)).

- **Characters, rebuilt again: they now look like people in hanfu.** The old figures had square, horizontal shoulders with the sleeves set on like shoulder pads, wide trapezoid "bell" sleeves with black insides, a white stripe of inner robe running from collar to hem like an apron, a turtleneck collar, thin strands of hair round a helmet and neon costumes. Now (`art/lib/garment.py`, `hair.py`, `person.py`):
  - **The cut of the robe**: narrower, sloping shoulders that run on into the sleeve with no seam (hanfu sleeves are cut in one with the bodice), arms that hang close to the body, a **V at the throat** where the crossed collars meet, and a **wrap-around skirt**, left over right, whose overlap edge carries the collar line down to the hem as one trimmed line.
  - **Sleeves** swept from the shoulder to the cuff as one surface: narrow seen from the front, deep seen from the side, the **pipa-shaped pocket** (mei) sagging behind the hand and gathered into a trimmed cuff (qu), on its own bone so it swings a beat behind the arm.
  - **Hair** in big clumps instead of thin strands: long hair falls as one continuous mass cut into pointed clumps at the ends, ponytails are full tails, side locks and fringes are wider; a highlight ring runs across dark hair.
  - **Proportions** of about 6.6 heads (a slightly larger head reads better at game distance), a thicker neck, softened plant-dye colours, a cape gathered over the shoulders on three bones.
- **Cel shading for characters and monsters** (`MB.mat_actor`): a soft two-tone ramp on the key light with **tinted shadows** (warm rose on skin, cool lavender on cloth and fur) instead of Godot's hard toon terminator, the ambient light that used to double every colour into neon cut back, a thin rim only on the lit side, toon highlights on metal, crystal and scales, and **coloured ink lines** (dark rose under skin, deep blue under a blue robe) drawn thinner than the scenery's.
- **Rigs**: every character gains a pocket bone per sleeve, finger and thumb bones, toe bones, a mouth bone for speech, a second hair bone and a third cape bone (26 to 37 bones).
- **Animation**: eleven clips instead of seven.  **Walk** rebuilt on contact, down, passing and up poses (the arms used to swing *with* the leg on the same side), a **qinggong run** with a flight phase and the cape, sleeves and hair streaming back (the hero crosses a 2 m tile every 0.16 s, so the old walk slid along the ground), **talk** (gestures, nods and a moving mouth), **bow** (the cupped-fist salute), **die** (a collapse that stays down), and idle, sit, attack, cast, hurt and victory redone with anticipation, follow-through and overlapping cloth.
- **Life in the world**: the hero and Yue Ling run on the road; whoever is speaking in a conversation gestures and moves their mouth; people bow as you walk up; **monster packs amble about their ground** with walk cycles and stop to face you when you come close; a fallen fighter collapses and stays down (party members until they are raised).
- **The world is no longer made of rectangles.**
  - **Shorelines** follow a smooth water field (the share of water round each corner, blurred and warped by noise, rounded towards the middle of every water tile) instead of tile corners; shore tiles are subdivided so the waterline curves, lone water tiles become round pools, banks slope down to a recessed waterline, and the foam follows the real depth instead of outlining every square tile in white. Water has teal shallows, deeper blue middles and a quieter sky reflection.
  - **Region borders meander**: ownership uses a two-scale domain warp, so borders wander like coasts and ridges on the world map and on the ground.
  - **No more rectangular clearings**: the forest reaches into every region from its edge by a depth that varies with noise, keeping clearings round every gate, arrival, person, boss, pickup, building and monster pack, and reconnecting anything it cuts off with trails that go round buildings.
  - Regions sit off the grid inside their bands.
- **More town buildings and people.** New building styles: **Huizhou houses** with white walls, black tiles and stepped horse-head fire walls, **thatched farmhouses**, a **two-storey teahouse** with a gallery, **shops** with awnings and signboards, **dormitories** and a **kitchen** with a smoking chimney. The sect gains a kitchen, a hall of martial practice and the disciples' dormitory; Qingshi Village a teahouse, a tofu shop, a carpentry, a farmhouse, a scholar's study and a granary. **Twelve new people** with their own Blender models and chat: Senior Brother Han, Junior Sister Mei, Auntie Zhou the cook, Little Bai (who sweeps the steps with Lin Feng's old broom), Gate Disciple Wu, Old Shen the bell-ringer, Farmer Lao, Little Hua, Tofu Seller Sun, Scholar Wang, Carpenter Gu and Xiao Lan the herb-picker.
- **Monsters sculpted, painted and animated** (`art/lib/clay.py`, `anatomy.py`, `canine.py`, `feline.py`, `bird.py`, `creature.py`): bodies are modelled from metaballs (balls, ellipsoids and capsule chains, each carrying smooth bone weights) instead of hundreds of outlined fur cards, with fur as shingled clumps that belong to the silhouette. Heads are built per species (the tiger's broad skull and cheek ruffs, the wolf's long muzzle and stop, the qilin's dragon head with one ridged horn and cloven hooves, the dragon's nine resemblances on an S-curved serpent body), and coats are painted in the grey values so a recolour still reads as an animal: tiger stripes and the king mark, the wolf's dark saddle and mask, the fox's white bib and black stockings, scales and belly plates. Horns, claws and fangs taper and shade from base to tip. Rigs gained spine, neck, jaw, ear, toe and long tail chains; every monster has **idle, walk, attack, hurt and die**, quadrupeds walk in the four-beat lateral sequence with the hips and chest bouncing out of step and the tail following through, insects and crabs walk on IK legs in an alternating tripod. Three new creatures: the **sun crow**, the **jade rabbit** and **Bifang**. The simpler shapes were restyled too: a **golem** of split, lichen-spotted boulders over a core that glows through the seams, a real **tortoise** (a high shell of raised scutes with growth rings over a plated underside, neck folds, a hooked beak and thick scaly legs), **scorpion, crab, spider and mantis** built from keeled exoskeleton segments (`anatomy.sclerite`) with proper chelae, an uneven crusher claw and raptorial forelegs, a **slime** that sags into a puddle with drips and half-swallowed things, a **jellyfish** with frilled oral arms and trailing tentacles, **mushroom folk** whose stems are their bodies, a **koi** with painted scales, barbels and trailing fins, a lofted **manta**, a scowling **thundercloud**, solid wisp flames and a tattered wraith. The person-shaped monsters (Ox-Head, Horse-Face, the hopping corpse, the Queen Mother and the rest) are built with the new character library.
- **Monsters in five colours, not one** (`Assets.palette`, `Builder.coat_slots`, research below). Each enemy's colour now expands into a palette with a clear hierarchy, as creature designers build one: a **dominant** colour over most of the body; a pale, cream-leaning **underside** (countershading on the belly, throat, bib and inner legs); **markings** that contrast in value (dark stripes, saddles, masks and tail tips on a light coat, pale ones on a dark coat); a **secondary** a clear step round the colour wheel and different in value (manes, wings, shells, fins, skirts of hair); and one small, saturated **accent** for the focal points, taken from the element (fire gold, water cyan, wood spring green, earth amber, thunder violet, dark magenta) or its alternate when the body already has that hue. The painted grey coats are split automatically (the pale parts blend into the underside, the dark ones into the markings, measured against the coat's median by surface area), and every creature got accent parts: the eyes of all of them, the dragon's dorsal spines, tail tuft and elbow flames, the qilin's horn, the serpent's horns and fin rays, the tiger's king mark, the wolf's brow spots, fox-fire, bird crests, the phoenix's tail eyes, the golem's molten core and faults, the ape's crest, crab claws, the scorpion's venom gland, spider and mantis eyes, moth eyespots, ghost-fire, storm runes and the jelly's glowing organs. The classic creatures keep the colours of the old texts: **Bifang** red markings on a blue-green body (the *Shan Hai Jing*: "red markings on a blue-green ground and a white beak"), **Hundun** a yellow sack red as cinnabar, **Bai Hu** white with black stripes, **Zhu Que** vermilion and gold, **Xuan Wu** a black shell lined in gold, the **Azure Dragon King** with a golden mane and cream belly plates, a nine-tailed fox with blue fox-fire.
- **Yue Ling no longer runs sideways** (see [bugs](#bugs-found-and-fixed)).
- **Part IX, "The Tenth Sun"** added +1 hour (see [below](#part-ix-the-tenth-sun)), verified by the playthrough bot; CI then required **9 hours**.
- **Art code** grew from 12,550 to 17,548 lines of Blender Python (+40%) and the game's GDScript from 17,359 to 19,113 lines; all 129 assets (63 people, 40 monsters, 26 props) rebuild from their scripts in about three minutes on four cores (the build now runs in parallel).
- **Bugs found and fixed** (see [below](#bugs-found-and-fixed)).

- **Characters look like people.** Every character is built by `art/lib/person.py` from new libraries. **Faces** (`face.py`) are sculpted on a skull: brow ridge, cheekbones, jaw and chin, a nose with alar wings, lips with a philtrum, eyes set into sockets under lids with a crease and lashes, ears with a helix, laugh lines and crow's feet for the old, and beards that grow from the face. **Hair** (`hair.py`) grows from a scalp with a real hairline as tapered locks, with fringes, side locks, a crown whorl and eight styles (topknot, long, bun, twin buns, braid, short, wild, bald), and dark hair gets a lighter sheen. **Clothes** (`garment.py`) are layered hanfu lofted around the body: inner robe, crossed collar, sash, hanging sleeves with a lining, a skirt that drapes, and armour of lamellar plates, pauldrons and tassets; hats, crowns, weapons, brocade motifs (cloud scrolls, waves, cranes, plum blossom), scars and freckles. Builds (slight to burly), age (the old stoop), femininity, and anime-leaning proportions (about 7 heads tall, larger eyes) follow the references. **Props and poses** (`accessory.py`): 29 hand-held items (gourds, fans, scrolls, lanterns, oars, fishing rods, abacus, flute, a cormorant...) with matching holding poses, so every NPC carries their trade.
- **Natural motion.** Idle with contrapposto and breathing, a walk with heel strike and counter-swinging arms, sitting, attacking, casting, hurt and victory clips; held props keep their pose while walking.
- **Monsters have anatomy.** `anatomy.py` builds quadrupeds the way the animals are built: a keel-shaped ribcage and tucked waist, withers and croup, muscled shoulders and haunches, **digitigrade legs** with the stifle forward and the hock back, paws with toe pads and claws, canine and feline skulls with a stop and a separate jaw, groomed fur clumps, feathers with a rachis, scale rows, plates, compound eyes, bristles, bark-covered limbs and veined leaves. The dragon follows the **nine resemblances** (camel head, deer antlers, rabbit eyes, cow ears, snake neck, clam belly, carp scales, eagle claws, tiger palms). All 29 old shapes were rebuilt and 8 new ones added: **qilin, ape, tiger, Queen Mother, River Warden, Crow Marshal, nine-faced Kaiming and magpie**, so lions, tigers, apes and qilin are no longer drawn as wolves.
- **Much richer colour palettes.** The art pipeline now stores a **palette slot** per vertex (primary, secondary, accent) next to the tint weight. In game, `Assets.palette()` turns one enemy colour into a scheme: a shade and a light of the primary blended by the surface's own value, an analogous secondary and a complementary accent (gold or blue for grey creatures). Quadrupeds get pale bellies and darker lower legs, manes, crests, fins and horns take the secondary, eyes, claws and glows the accent. Characters' costumes are **harmonised** from their robe colour: a pastel inner robe, deeper trousers, a contrasting sash and collar, light trim.
- **Landmarks** (all 26 props) gained sculpted detail within their triangle budgets, and four new ones mark Part VIII: the ferry post, the magpie pine, the star pillar and the jade peach tree.
- **Part VIII** adds +1 hour (see below), verified by the playthrough bot; CI now requires **8 hours**. The ending gains the **magpie bridge** (`art/props/magpiebridge.py`) with the Cowherd and the Weaver meeting on it.
- **Asset validation in CI.** `art/check_assets.py` reads every exported GLB without Blender and checks the script-to-file pairing, the three material slots, vertex colours and tint UVs, triangle budgets, the bones the game drives and the animation clips.
- **Blender Python art code doubled**: 6,272 to 12,549 lines (`art/lib` 5,389, characters 770, monsters 4,704, props 1,489, tools 198).
- **Bugs found and fixed** (see below).

- **One open world.** All 30 regions and the sect now lie on one continuous map (492 x 448 tiles, about 1 x 0.9 km). Azure Cloud Mountain with the sect on its slope runs down the west side; each chapter's chain of regions runs east from it as a band of land, and Part II's chain snakes back west beneath Part I's. You walk from region to region along roads: there are no loading gates or teleports any more. A region the story has not opened yet is closed by a **Lotus Seal** barrier across its road, which dissolves into an open archway when the Elder (or the boss before it) lets you through. The 3D view streams regions in as you approach them and drops the far ones; the minimap scrolls with you, and **Esc > World Map** shows the whole land.
- **Less squarish terrain.** Region borders are no longer straight walls: the land between two regions is a forest-and-rock belt whose edges wander with noise, and the change of ground, trees and sky follows the same wavy line. Connecting trails wander on the diagonal instead of running in L-shaped corridors, the mountain roads meander, the water plane runs on under the banks so shorelines follow the shape of the ground, the sect's lotus pond is an oval, and hilliness blends smoothly from one region to the next.
- **Buildings you can enter.** The sect's Hall of Azure Clouds, the Alchemist's Pharmacy, the Smithy and a new Scripture Library are hollow buildings with a door, plank floors, lattice windows, lanterns and furniture (altar and founder statue, cauldron and herb racks, hearth, anvil and weapon rack, bookshelves). Qingshi Village has five more (Granny Wen's house, an inn, a shrine, a weaver's workshop and an abandoned house) and the tea terraces and silk woods one each. Walk in through the door and the roof lifts away; the Elder, Alchemist Mo, Smith Tie and the villagers wait inside.
- **Part VII** adds +1 hour (see below), verified by the playthrough bot; CI now requires **7 hours**.
- **Bugs found and fixed** (see below).

- **Natural landscapes instead of stamped copies.** Trees are grown by code from 43 species recipes, each in several seeded variants, with leaf-card canopies lit as one soft volume that glow when back-lit and move in rolling gusts. An ecology layer places them: dense tall forest inside blocked areas, young trees and shrubs at the edges, species gathering in natural stands, ferns, logs and stumps along forest borders, reeds and lotus at the water, flowers in meadows, rocks where the ground is rocky, and thick wind-blown grass. Wildlife moves through it.
- **Architecture.** The sect's halls are rebuilt the traditional way (platform, balustrade, lions, columns with bracket sets, lattice doors, painted beams, curved double-eaved roofs), with a courtyard wall, gate archways and a pagoda. Every road that crosses water gets a stone bridge; huts, shrines, watchtowers, tents, yurts, pavilions and ruins dot the wilds; the built regions get 10 new Blender landmarks.
- **Characters and monsters.** The character builder gained layered hair, richer eyes, fingers, cloth folds, embroidery and animal heads; 19 new characters (every NPC is now a Blender model) and 17 new monsters, so no enemy shape uses the old primitive models any more.
- **A clearer image.** The "slightly blurry lens" look is gone. The frame had no anti-aliasing and was softened by a low-threshold bloom over everything, a soft-light glow, heavy fog with aerial perspective, film grain and chromatic aberration. Now: 4x MSAA, glow only on genuinely bright highlights, light fog, and no grain or fringing.
- **Third-person follow camera.** The camera sits low behind Lin Feng and swings round behind him whenever he walks, so you see his back rather than his side; a held direction key keeps its heading while the camera turns. Trees, rocks, landmarks and buildings standing between the camera and the hero dissolve in an ordered dither, and Yue Ling walks at his shoulder instead of in the camera's way.
- **Part VI** adds +1 hour (see below), verified by the playthrough bot; CI now requires **6 hours**.
- **Graphics code grew from 8,667 to 15,036 lines** (+73%: 8,862 lines of GDScript graphics modules, 6,174 lines of Blender Python).
- **Bugs and plot holes found and fixed** (see below), including one that hid every pond, lake and river in the game.

## Art pipeline

**Rule: all art is generated from scripts.** Every model, texture, animation and effect must be reproducible by running code that lives in this repository. Hand-made, downloaded or AI-image-generated asset files are not allowed. Rendered screenshots in `docs/screenshots` are outputs, not inputs.

| Source | Use it for | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Godot code** (GDScript and shaders) | anything built from game data or changing at runtime: terrain, weather, spell effects, shaders, UI | `scripts/` |
| **Blender Python** (`bpy`, Blender 5.2) | hero assets: characters, monsters, rigs and animations, landmarks | `art/` |

- `art/lib/kit.py`: the toolkit. Coordinates are written in Godot space; primitives (ellipsoids, superquadrics, swept tubes with per-point bone weights, lathes, double-sided sheets, leaves, eyes), organic bodies from Blender's **Skin + Subdivision modifiers**, **ray-cast ambient occlusion** baked into vertex colours, the **Decimate** modifier for landmark triangle budgets, armatures, clips baked from Python functions and GLB export.
- `art/lib/person.py` builds every character from options (robe, hair style, hat, weapon, beard, horns, build, age, props, pose, brocade, tinting) with `face.py`, `hair.py`, `garment.py` and `accessory.py`, and the features of the peoples of the realms (wings, crests, fox and fin ears, tails, antlers, scales, whiskers) with `race.py`; `sculpt.py` holds the shared modelling tools (lofts through cross-section profiles, noise, splines, strands).
- `art/lib/clay.py` sculpts creature bodies from metaballs (balls, ellipsoids, capsule chains) that carry smooth bone weights and paint tags; `anatomy.py` builds species heads, torsos, legs, paws, hooves, tails, fur clumps, eyes, ears, horns, claws and fangs; `canine.py`, `feline.py` and `bird.py` build the dog, cat and bird families; `art/lib/creature.py` holds the rigs, IK for legs, gait timing, the shared four-legged motion set and the clip helpers.
- `art/characters/*.py`, `art/monsters/*.py`, `art/props/*.py`: one script per asset, each writing `assets/<group>/<name>.glb`.
- Vertex colour alpha carries the toon shader's surface class, UV.x a tint weight, UV.y a **palette slot** (0 dominant, 0 to 0.2 blending into the underside, 0.5 secondary, 0.6 to 0.8 blending into the markings, 1 accent; `Builder.coat_slots` fills the underside and markings from a monster's painted coat, and `Assets.palette` turns the enemy's colour and element into the five colours), and the material slot (`toon`, `plain`, `glow`) chooses the game shader; `scripts/assets.gd` swaps the materials in at load time and turns the enemy's colour into a palette, so Blender and procedural models share one look.
- `python art/check_assets.py` validates every export (pairing with its script, materials, colours and UVs, triangle budgets, bones, clips); CI runs it after the rebuild.
- Builds are deterministic: rebuilding produces byte-identical files on the same machine. CI rebuilds every asset from its script.
- Every art change is checked visually with the screenshot tour (`--tour`, `--gallery`).

```sh
pip install bpy==5.2.3                        # Blender as a Python module (or use a Blender install)
python art/build_all.py                       # rebuild all 174 assets in parallel (several minutes on 4 cores; ART_JOBS=N)
python art/check_assets.py                     # validate the exports
blender --background --python art/monsters/hundun.py   # or one asset with Blender itself
godot --headless --path . --import            # re-import into Godot

Walk into NPCs, enemies, pickups, stairs and bosses to interact with them; walking up to a boss that guards the story opens its trial, with every way through it. There is no save system yet: a full run takes about fifteen hours. Esc > Journal shows your renown, essences and treasures, what townsfolk have asked of you, and every way through the trial ahead. Esc > Cultivation shows your realm (and what it means) and the branches of the Nine Heavens root you have woken; Esc > World Map shows the whole land and the history of where you are (Left/Right turns to the Nine Heavens, the Nine Springs and the Eastern Sea once you have been there); Esc > Annals keeps the history of everywhere you have been; Esc > Dao & Peoples shows the Daos you have walked and your standing with the peoples of the realms.

## Gameplay

- **Cultivation**: gain cultivation by meditating (Esc, Meditate) and winning battles. 55 stages across nineteen realms (up to Myriad Daos as One); at the end of each realm you must pass a **Heavenly Tribulation** boss fight to break through. **Realms matter**: a whole realm between two fighters is felt in every blow (realm suppression, x1.2 a realm, up to three), beasts two realms below you scatter, the Founder's nine caves on the mountain open only at their realm, and the world notices the realm you have reached (Esc > Cultivation).
- **Talents: the nine branches of the Nine Heavens root** (Esc > Cultivation): when your qi first stirs, at every tribulation and in every Founder's cave a branch wakes and you choose which: the Sword Bone, the Thunder, Five-Phase and Yin Roots, the Vajra Body, the Sea of Qi, the Enlightened Mind, Heaven's Favour or Spirit Sense, three ranks each and a crown at full leaf. The world grows with the root, so what you wake decides how you keep up.
- **Trials and many roads**: 34 battles that carry the story forward (two lords in every chapter, three in the first, the eight Gate Generals and Chiyou) are trials, harder than the bosses before them and open only to a cultivator who has prepared one of their three or four ways: by might, by craft, by wealth, by respect, by the Dao, by a people's friendship or by a relic. The way taken changes the battle (a weaker foe, allies striking every round, wards, a weakness shown) and the ending names the road you walked most.
- **Crafting**: every foe may leave an essence of its element (bosses always do); Alchemist Mo's cauldron and Smith Tie's forge make 29 talismans, lenses, seals, inks, mirrors and elixirs from essences, things found on the quests and spirit stones.
- **Renown and deeds**: bosses, trials and gifts raise your renown, and so do 28 deeds, requests from townsfolk all over the world; seven titles from Unknown to Legendary, and every respect path asks for a name earned by helping people.
- **Turn-based combat** with qi-costed techniques, elemental weaknesses (fire / water / wood / earth / thunder / dark), pills, a healer companion (Yue Ling) and boss heavy attacks.
- **Fifty regions in four realms**: forty-two on a continent within the Four Seas, two in the Nine Heavens above it, two in the Nine Springs below it and four on the Isles of the Eastern Sea out past its shelf, each with elites, bosses and a hunt objective, joined by winding roads, the Jianmu and Mazu's boat, and **eleven towns** (the sect, Cloudfoot, Qingshi Village, Yanggu, Shazhou Oasis, Longmen, Tushan, Featherfall, Tearwater, Youdu and Landfall). **Part I**: the Sect, Whispering Bamboo Forest, Crimson Marsh, Frostpeak Caverns, Thunder Valley and the Blood Moon Palace. **Part II**: the Sunken Dragon Palace, Ashen Volcano, Void Rift Expanse and the Celestial Gate. **Part III**: the Mirror Lake of Echoes, the Graveyard of Sword Saints, the River of Ten Thousand Years and the Origin of the Dao. **Part IV**: the Sea of Clouds Archipelago, the Ruins of the Jade Court, Heaven's Forge and the Garden of Immortal Peaches. **Part V**: the Desert of Fallen Stars, Glowcap Vale, the Aurora Steppe and the Primordial Chaos. **Part VI**: the Maple Gorge of Returning Souls, the Stone Forest of the Nine Bends, the Yellow Springs of Red Lilies and the Wheel of the Six Paths. **Part VII**: Qingshi Village Below the Mountain, the Cloud-Tea Terraces, the Mulberry Silk Woods and the Loom of Borders. **Part VIII**: the Starfall Ferry on the Silver River, the Heights of the Magpie Bridge, the Palace of the Weaver Star and the Jasper Pool of Kunlun. **Part IX**: Yanggu, the Dawn Market; the Scorched Millet Plains; Fusang, the Valley of Sunrise; and Guanghan, the Palace of the Moon. **Part X**: Longmen, the Dragon Gate Ferry; the Drowned Fields of Gun; Tushan, the Town of the Cauldron-Casters; and Mount Buzhou, the Broken Pillar. **Part XI**: Juntian, the Level Heaven, and Changhe, the Gate of Heaven, in the Nine Heavens; the Nine Springs beneath the Roots and Youdu, the Dark Capital, in the Nine Springs. **Part XII**: Penglai, the Isle of the Immortals (Landfall); Fangzhang, the Square-Pot Isle; Yingzhou, the Isle of Mists; and Guixu, the Returning Ruins, in the Eastern Sea. **Part XIII (new)**: the Eight Gates, in eight of these regions across all four realms, and the buried field of Zhuolu under the oldest maples of the Maple Gorge.
- **Techniques** for the late game: Abyssal Tide, Meteor Rain, Void Rending Slash, Celestial Judgement, Chrono Severance, Genesis Sword, Ten Thousand Starfall, Ledger-Breaking Stroke, Sky-Mending Sword, Five-Colour Stone Rain, Pillar of Heaven Strike, Six Paths Wheel Slash, Ten Thousand Lantern Rain, Samsara Sword, Seam-Cutting Sword, Thousand-Thread Rain, Boundless Heart Sword, Magpie Bridge Sword, Silver River Torrent, Seventh-Night Reunion Sword, Noon-Splitting Sword, Fall of the Nine Suns, Tenth Arrow Sword, Dragon Gate Leap, Swelling Earth Rampart, Nine Cauldrons Sword, Strike of the Standing Tree, Torrent of the Nine Springs, Three Realms Concord Sword, **Returning Tide Sword**, **Rain over the Five Isles** and **Jingwei's Stone Sword**, plus Yue Ling's Starlight Rain, Dawn Lotus, Seal Bloom, Five-Colour Thread, Nuwa's Mending, Spirit Lantern Ward, Lotus of Rebirth, Silver Silk Snare, Homeward Lantern, Starweave Net, Magpie Wing Ward, Osmanthus Moon Rain, Moon-Dew Ward, Reed-Boat Blossom, River-Mother's Ward, Rain of Phoenix Feathers, Ward of the Standing Tree, **Spray of the Pearl Trees** and **Mazu's Red Lantern** (the reviving heals also raise a fallen ally); and the six **Dao techniques** (Ten Thousand Swords Return to One, Peng's Wind of Ninety Thousand Li, Lotus Heart Sutra, Eight Trigrams Grand Array, Nine-Turn Golden Elixir Fire and Mirror-Flower, Water-Moon), one for each Dao from Adept on.
- **Upstairs and down**: 30 upper storeys and cellars, each reached by its stairs, with people, quest scenes and hidden keepsakes; the Jianmu's stairs climb to the Nine Heavens and go down to the Nine Springs, and Mazu's boat sails from Fusang to the isles.
- **Cutscenes**: conversations over the world play out with gestures (nod, shake, point, wave, laugh, grieve, think, kneel, offer, shock, bow) picked from each line, answered by the listener, and framed by a two-shot conversation camera.
- **Daos** (Esc > Dao & Peoples): choose one of six roads when the Jianmu grows back and change at any Dao Stele; each has a mastery from Novice to Master, passive powers that grow with it and a technique from Adept on, and the story answers the one you walk.
- **The peoples of the realms**: the Feathered Folk, the dragon-kin, the celestial foxes, the Pearl-Weepers, the Deathless, the shades of Youdu, the Thousand Children of Landfall and the Immortals of the Isles; your standing with each grows with the help you give in their lands and with the keepsakes you give them, faster if you walk the Dao they honour, and a people that calls you Friend grants a boon.
- **The Annals** (Esc > Annals): the history of every region and town Lin Feng has been to, and the Founder's words from every cave he has opened; the world map shows the one he is standing in.
- **Economy**: spirit stones buy pills, tempering for your sword, what the cauldron and the forge make, and the wealth paths through the trials.

## Part III: The Hollow Heaven

After the Jade Emperor falls and Lin Feng merges with the Dao, the Heavenly Lotus Seal recalls him to the sect, where Elder Qing Xuan finally explains what the Seal is, who the Emperor was and why the sky is still cracking. Four new regions, 16 bosses, 12 monsters and five dialogue-heavy quest chains (about +1 hour) follow:

| Region | Levels | Story beat | Final boss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mirror Lake of Echoes | 18-19 | The lake remembers the nineteen bearers before Lin Feng | Echo of Xu Mo |
| Graveyard of Sword Saints | 19-20 | The Seal's key and the founder of the sect | Founder Qing Lian |
| *Mahayana tribulation* | | | |
| River of Ten Thousand Years | 21-22 | The Emperor's origin as the first sweeper | Tian Xuan, the First Sweeper |
| Origin of the Dao | 22-23 | Yue Ling's secret and the Hollow Heaven | The Hollow Heaven |
| *True Immortal tribulation and ending* | | | |

## Part IV: The Unwritten Ledger

Lin Feng ascends as a True Immortal, but across the golden dawn someone is writing names in jade ink: the nineteen bearers, and his own. The Lotus Seal pulls him home, where everyone who ever survived a tribulation is ageing by the hour. The harvest had a bookkeeper: the Heavenly Court's **Jade Ledger**, still trying to balance its columns by collecting years from the living. Four new regions, 16 bosses, 12 monsters, five quest chains (each with a hunt, a collection and a delivery scene) and a new realm follow:

| Region | Levels | Story beat | Final boss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sea of Clouds Archipelago | 24-25 | The Court's tollgate in the sky; a cloud-step woven from feathers | Herald of the Ledger, Qian Shu |
| Ruins of the Jade Court | 25 | A runaway scribe, four Jade Seals and the brush that wrote every name | Grand Registrar Si Ming |
| Heaven's Forge | 25-26 | Where every tribulation bolt was hammered; the brush is reforged to unwrite | Forge-Lord Tian Gong |
| Garden of Immortal Peaches | 26 | The nineteen bearers wake and remember their names | The Jade Ledger |
| *Dao Ancestor tribulation and new ending* | | | |

Part III's ending now flows into Part IV (the final ascension sets up the Ledger instead of closing the story), and the ending screen reflects the new finale.

## Part V: The Falling Sky

Lin Feng keeps his word and sweeps the steps, until stars start falling at noon. The Heavenly Court had propped up the sky with the years it harvested; with the Ledger closed, nothing holds it. Nuwa once mended the sky with stones of five colours and set four pillars beneath it. The eastern pillar still stands because the Azure Dragon King (freed in Part II) holds it up out of gratitude; the other three wardens have starved and gone wild, and at the centre Hundun, the faceless chaos from before the world, is waking. Four regions, 16 bosses, 12 monsters, five quest chains and a new realm:

| Region | Levels | Story beat | Final boss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Desert of Fallen Stars | 27 | Nomads who sing star fragments back into the sky | Bai Hu, White Tiger of the West |
| Glowcap Vale | 27-28 | A spore-witch's glowcaps rekindle a cold fire | Zhu Que, Vermilion Bird of the South |
| Aurora Steppe | 28-29 | The sky's breath, caught on the snow, wakes a frozen god | Xuan Wu, Black Tortoise of the North |
| Primordial Chaos | 29 | The First Lightning, Pangu's shadow and the Ancestor Lin Feng refused to become | Hundun, the Faceless Chaos |
| *Primordial Sovereign tribulation and new ending* | | | |

New creature types built in Blender for Part V: scorpion, mushroom folk, mammoth, lantern moth and Hundun (four wings, six legs, no face).

| up the Jianmu's trunk, then east across the islands | Part XI | Juntian (Featherfall), Changhe | the stair round the Jianmu, west of the sect |

Each region is still generated from its own seed by `mapgen.gd` (so every boss, NPC and herb keeps its place), but its open ground is no longer the rectangle of its map: an ellipse filling the map is pushed into lobes and bays by a domain warp, bitten by a second noise and frayed at the edge, with clearings kept round everything that matters and trails (a cost-weighted A* that goes round buildings) joining anything left in the forest. `atlas.gd` then turns the map to face the way its road runs and lays it at its site. Every tile of the world belongs to the region whose site is nearest, measured in that region's own half-sizes after a two-scale domain warp (and the land round a region's people, bosses, gates and buildings always belongs to it); a forest belt marks where two regions meet. Land runs out about two half-sizes from the nearest site, which gives the continent its coast, the fjords between the mountain's spurs and the inner sea in the north-east, and fades out towards the edge of the world, which is always open sea. Roads are searched for with A* across the land (old paths cheap, forest dear, water dearer, a slow noise to make them wind), keep to their own two regions and cross the border between them exactly once, on a land bridge raised for them; where a chapter is not open yet, a Lotus Seal stands across the road at that crossing. Tests check that every entity can be walked to, that with all seals shut only the sect, the mountain (with Cloudfoot) and the bamboo forest can be reached, that the sea rings the land, that regions are not laid out in rows and columns, that every region's corners are mostly forest, and that the world is deterministic.

**The realms above and below** (Part XI) are built by the same `Atlas._build`, one realm at a time (`Atlas.world_of(layer)`): `STRATA` gives each its own 260 x 200 grid, the sites of its regions, how far land reaches from a site (land runs out into open sky or into the abyss instead of the sea) and how many holes to open in the wild ground between regions (gaps of sky between the islands, chasms between the caverns). `layer_origin` lays each grid over the land's so that the Jianmu's crown in the Nine Heavens floats straight above its trunk on the mountain and its roots in the Nine Springs hang straight below. The ends of a ladder are two linked entities, one in each realm; walking onto one lifts or lowers Lin Feng and puts him on the free tile beside the other end. The Nine Heavens are drawn 96 m above the land and the Nine Springs 64 m below it, and `world.gd` keeps a bundle per realm (its land, its streamed regions, its sea of cloud or glowing abyss) and shows only the one Lin Feng is in. A **floor** (`Atlas.floor_id`, `f:<region>:<building>:<level>`) is a world of its own the size of its building, holding the people and things that live on it and the stairs back.

The 3D view builds a region when the player comes within 46 tiles of the bounding box of its land: its own land is cut out of the world grid (other regions' tiles and the open sea blanked), corner heights come from one shared height field so neighbours meet without a crack, and the usual terrain, ecology, wildlife and buildings are built for it. The sea is a single surface for the whole world (`Terrain3D.world_sea`), running on to the horizon. Far regions are hidden and the furthest dropped.

## Part XIII: The Eight Gates

Every water has come home, and for a whole autumn nothing goes away that does not come back. So the peoples of the four realms agree to meet on Azure Cloud Mountain, under the Jianmu, for the first **Conclave of the Realms**, with no Court at the head of the table because there is no head of the table. On the eve of it eight bars of gold light go up at once, two in each realm. The Elder knows what they are: the **Eight Gates** of the Qimen art, which the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens taught the Yellow Emperor to win the war at Zhuolu, and which the Court, not yet the Court, set round the grave of the war god **Chiyou** so that his war would never wake. The lock answered to the Court. The Court is gone, every water comes home through Lin Feng now, and it seems the dead would like to as well.

This chapter is **not a line**. After the Elder, the Archivist (who found the Lady's own war-book propping up a table), **Yinglong** at Mount Buzhou (the winged dragon who killed Chiyou at Zhuolu, and never flew home to heaven after it: "He was a smith. The first. He made ploughs before he ever made an axe") and the lantern monk of the Maple Gorge (where Chiyou's fetters, struck off him, grew into the first maples), and once his war-band has been driven back off the funeral road, **any four of the eight gates, in any order**, break the lock, and each gate is a **trial** with its own ways through:

| Gate | Trigram | Where | General | Its ways |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Opening** | Qian, heaven | Changhe, the Nine Heavens | Xingtian, Who Dances Without a Head | the Sword (Adept), Kin of the celestial foxes, 150,000 stones (Pixiu's gold given back) |
| **Alarm** | Dui, lake | Juntian, the Nine Heavens | Yu Shi, the Rain Master of Zhuolu | Free Wandering (Adept), Kin of the Feathered Folk, the Fan of Nuba's Drought (crafted) |
| **Rest** | Kan, water | the Nine Springs | Liang, Goblin of the Black Springs | the Compassionate Heart (Adept), Kin of the Pearl-Weepers, two Vials of the Nine Springs poured back |
| **Death** | Kun, earth | Youdu | the Bronze-Headed Brothers of Chiyou | Formations (Adept), Kin of the shades, renown 560 |
| **Sight** | Li, fire | Yingzhou, the Eastern Sea | Chiyou's Banner, the Red Comet | the Mirror (Adept), the Mirror of Clear Sight (crafted), Middle Ten Thousand Waters Return |
| **Closing** | Xun, wind | Guixu, the Eastern Sea | Mei, Goblin of the Old Mast | 160,000 stones (the Lost Fleet's wages), Yu Qiang's conch and a handful of mainland earth, Kin of the Thousand Children |
| **Life** | Gen, mountain | the Maple Gorge, the land | the Fetter-Maple of Chiyou | the Cauldron (Adept), Kin of the Deathless, two pressed autumn leaves |
| **Harm** | Zhen, thunder | Mount Buzhou, the land | the Drum of Kui's Hide | Middle Ten Thousand Waters Return and a fully tempered sword, the Drumstick of the Thunder-Beast (crafted), renown 580 |

A **war-band** of Chiyou's host (Warriors of the Nine Li, the Fog of Zhuolu, Bronze-Browed Brothers, Fetter-Maple Saplings and Embers of Chiyou's Banner) marches in every gate's region once the formation wakes: the only foes in the old regions who still stand and fight a cultivator of Ten Thousand Waters Return, and the way to the new realm. Every gate opened beyond four takes 6% off Chiyou. When the fourth falls, the fog lifts off the Maple Gorge and the buried field of **Zhuolu** lies open under the oldest maples. Before walking into it Lin Feng carries the Elder's invitations to the Conclave to **any four of the eight peoples' leaders, in any order** (the Feather-Mother, the Rain-Minister, the Ninth-Tail Matron, the Pearl-Weaver, the elder of the Deathless, the Lantern-Magistrate, the Headwoman of Landfall and He Xiangu), each with something to say about the war god, and then there are **three roads** into the field:

| Road | What it asks | The battle | How it ends |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Road of the Sword** | Master of the Dao you walk, and cultivation full at Late Ten Thousand Waters Return | Chiyou at his full strength (twice the health of a boss, a quarter more attack), as the Yellow Emperor met him; his weakness shown, and the first blow yours | Chiyou laughs, lies down in the field and closes his eyes for the first time since he died; his axes hang in the Hall of Azure Clouds |
| **The Road of the Many Peoples** | every people of the realms calls you Friend, and renown 600 | the envoys of four realms at your back, quarrelling: allies strike every round and the party takes a fifth less harm | the war god of the Nine Li, who fought for nine tribes arguing round one fire, takes a seat at the Conclave as the envoy of a people five thousand years gone |
| **The Road of the Cauldron** | the Elixir of Coming Home: five essences of five elements, an autumn leaf and 300,000 spirit stones at Alchemist Mo's cauldron | he smells the Nine Li on it: he begins at 60% of his strength and strikes softer | he drinks it, turns to autumn leaves from the feet up and blows away east to the plains where his people lived |

Then the Conclave meets (on the sect's practice ground, the only place flat enough for a dragon to sit down) and the last tribulation asks Lin Feng which road he will choose, and he does not have to: **Myriad Daos as One**, a realm in which every road leads somewhere worth going.

## Part XII: The Returning Ruins

Every road goes somewhere now, and for a season Lin Feng sweeps the steps in the mornings and the first hundred steps of the Standing Tree in the evenings. Then a fishing boat comes up the south-east road on an ox-cart: the sea went out in the night and did not come back. East of the Eastern Sea, the *Liezi* says, lies **Guixu, the Returning Ruins**, a ravine without a bottom into which every river, every sea and the Silver River pour, and which never fills and never empties, because everything that goes in comes back. Over it stood the five **Isles of the Immortals**, held up on the heads of fifteen great turtles; a giant of Longbo fished up six of them and two isles sank. The Court hid the rest in a mirage, so nobody could pick years off the pearl trees while it was selling them by the column, and put a bronze stopper in Guixu so that water came back only where the Rain Ministry signed for it. Somebody has pulled the stopper out. At Fusang, where the sun rises out of the sea, **Mazu**, who brings the boats home, takes Lin Feng across what is left of the sea in her boat.

| Guixu, the Returning Ruins | the Eastern Sea | 100 x 64 | 50 | The wreck of Xu Fu's flagship and its ghostly steersman; Xu Fu's torn logbook; the drowned summit of Daiyu at the lip of the Ruins | Xu Fu, Who Sought the Elixir |

- **A fourth realm**, the **Eastern Sea** (`Atlas.STRATA.sea`), built like the others (sites, warped ownership, land that runs out into real sea, roads and seals) on a 520 x 200 grid of its own: four isles in a chain running east, the sea between them crossed on the sandbars the drain has left bare. **Mazu's boat** joins it to Fusang: a new kind of crossing (`"style": "sail"`) at a jetty on the pool where the ten suns bathed, with a boat built in code (a junk with a red batten sail and eyes on the bow), a sea-blue fade and its own map page.
- **Sixteen bosses** from the old texts: Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er, Mazu's runaway generals, hired by Xu Fu as lookouts; the Sea-Monk who drowns fishermen; **the Giant of Longbo**; the White Deer of Longevity; the Elixir Furnace That Walked Away; the Pearl Tree That Will Not Fruit; **Tianwu**, the eight-headed god of the waters; **Wu Zixu**, god of the tidal bore, who stopped the tide; **Shen**, the clam-dragon whose breath made the mirage; the Great Ao who bears Yingzhou; **Yu Qiang**; the Admiral of the Lost Fleet; the Bronze Stopper of Guixu; **Ruo of the Northern Sea**, the sea itself (who once humbled the River Earl of Part X); and **Xu Fu**. Xu Fu and Yu Qiang answer the Dao Lin Feng walks.
- **Twelve new monsters**: Mirage Wisps, Sharks Stranded by the Low Tide and Sandbar Crabs on Penglai; Cinnabar Toads of the Furnaces, Cranes Who Steal Elixirs and Herb-Thief Rabbits on Fangzhang; Phantoms of the Sea-Mist, White Horses of the Tidal Bore and Shell-Armoured Tide Soldiers on Yingzhou; Drowned Sailors of the Lost Fleet, Eels of the Bottomless Ravine and Sentinels of the Sunken Isles at Guixu.
- **Two new peoples**: the **Thousand Children of Landfall** (honour the Compassionate Heart, love a handful of mainland earth, their friendship finds more spirit stones) and the **Immortals of the Isles** (honour Free Wandering, love a cake of new Cloud-Tea, their friendship makes every battle teach more).
- **New techniques**: the Returning Tide Sword, Rain over the Five Isles and Jingwei's Stone Sword (taught by Jingwei) for Lin Feng; Spray of the Pearl Trees and Mazu's Red Lantern (it raises the fallen) for Yue Ling.
- **A new town, Landfall**, with a Hall of the Thousand Names (and its gallery upstairs), the Wine-House of the Drunken Immortal (where Lu Dongbin drinks upstairs), a temple to Mazu, a shipyard on the sand (and its rope store) and the net-menders' house; Fangzhang has He Xiangu's Lotus Hall, the House of the Nine Furnaces and the herb-keepers' lodge; Yingzhou the Shrine of the Fifteen Turtles and its tally-room; Guixu the wreck of the flagship *Penglai-Seeker*. **23 new characters**, among them the Eight Immortals (Lu Dongbin with his sword and fly-whisk, Iron-Crutch Li, Lan Caihe, Han Xiangzi with his flute, He Xiangu with her lotus, Zhang Guolao with his fish-drum, Zhongli Quan with his fan and Cao Guojiu with his broken court tablet), Mazu, Jingwei with her speckled wings, and the ghosts of Xu Fu's lost fleet.
- **Set pieces built in code** (`terrain3d.gd`): the **Pavilion of Penglai**, an octagonal two-storey pavilion on a white sea-cliff with a mirage of pale towers hanging over the water; and **the lip of Guixu**, the sea pouring round and round in a funnel of dark water and foam down into a ravine without a bottom, with a faint glow far below. Four new region looks: the pearl-white haze of Penglai, the golden afternoon of the immortals' gardens, the grey-green mists of Yingzhou and the violet storm over the bare sea floor at the Ruins.
- **A new realm**, Ten Thousand Waters Return, with its own tribulation; the ending adds the isles on their sleeping turtles below the clouds, with Jingwei's reefs beside them, Mazu's lantern-boat drifting between them and Jingwei flying a pebble over the sea.

## Part XI: The Ladder of Heaven

The land keeps its own shape, and for a season everybody lets it. Then one morning the whole mountain shudders, and by sunrise a tree stands west of the sect that was not there the night before: a trunk wider than the Hall, not one branch below the clouds, roots that have split the hillside open. The Elder knows it. It is the **Jianmu**, the Standing Tree, the ladder at the middle of the world by which gods climbed down to visit and people climbed up to complain, until the sage-king Zhuanxu sent his grandsons Chong to lift heaven up and Li to press the earth down, and between them they cut the ladder through. The Court made a government of the severing: one ladder, kept by the Court, one road up it, obedience. With the land in its own shape again the tree has remembered how to grow, and whatever comes down it, or up through its roots, will ask Lin Feng one thing first: what is your Dao? He chooses a road, finds the record of the severing in the Sealed Archive under the Scripture Library and goes to meet whoever has climbed down the trunk.

| Region | Realm | Size | Levels | Story beat | Final boss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| *Azure Cloud Sect and the Jianmu's foot* | the land | | | The Elder asks which Dao Lin Feng will walk; Archivist Lan reads the record of the severing in the Sealed Archive; Ling Yu of the Feathered Folk climbs down the tree to see whether the middle world is as horrible as the stories | |
| Juntian, the Level Heaven | the Nine Heavens | 100 x 64 | 45-46 | Featherfall's chicks will not hatch while the winds run wild; four wind bells go back up the Aerie Tower, and the Rain-Minister, sulking in the Archive of Rain because nobody signs his ledgers any more, picks up a brush himself | Leigong, Duke of Thunder |
| Changhe, the Gate of Heaven | the Nine Heavens | 92 x 60 | 45-46 | The celestial foxes keep the Gate as a joke and hid its four keys as the punchline; the door gods let Lin Feng through to Chong, who has held heaven up for four thousand years and cannot hear any more | Chong, Who Lifts Heaven |
| The Nine Springs beneath the Roots | the Nine Springs | 96 x 62 | 46-47 | Down the roots to Tearwater on the black water: the springs run thin and bitter, the Deathless explain that the tree pushes up while Li pushes down, and the roots are caught between them like a hand in a door | Zhulong, the Torch Dragon |
| Youdu, the Dark Capital | the Nine Springs | 100 x 64 | 47 | The rolls of the dead have scattered and Black and White Impermanence are collecting the living; Houtu, Sovereign Earth, gives Lin Feng the earth's own blessing; Tubo opens the inner gate | Li, Who Presses Down the Earth |
| *Three Realms Concord tribulation: hold heaven, earth and the middle world in one breath, the way you hold a ladder steady for somebody else to climb* | | | | | |

Four new region looks: the bright high air of Juntian over the cloud sea, the violet-and-gold dusk at the Gate of Heaven, the teal glow of the caverns under the roots (lit red from the east by the Torch Dragon's eye) and the ghost-fire of the Dark Capital.
- **Three new towns**: **Featherfall**, the Feathered Folk's aeries round the Jianmu's crown, with an Aerie Tower, a fletching loft, an Egg-Nursery and the Rain Ministry; **Tearwater**, a town of shell and silk on the black water, with the Hall of the Pearl-Weavers and the House under the Great Root; and **Youdu**, the Dark Capital, with its Ward Office, a paper-horse shop, the Inn of the Last Lantern and the Palace of Sovereign Earth.
- The **ending** raises the Jianmu behind everything, from the clouds below to the top of the sky, with feathers, pearls and lanterns climbing it and a slow ring of the six Daos' colours round its trunk; and the last words of the story ("Later they will tell it as the story of...") follow the Dao Lin Feng walked.

## Part X: The Nine Cauldrons

A month after the sun and the moon agree to take turns, Archivist Lan comes running into the courtyard in her nightcap: the great map in the Scripture Library, the Court's survey, is wrong. The rivers have moved; the coasts have bays; the roads go round bends that were never drawn. The Elder explains that the Heavenly Court surveyed the land into squares so that every square could be taxed in years, and pinned the corners with the Nine Cauldrons that Yu the Great cast when he tamed the Flood, engraved with the true map of the Nine Provinces. With the Court gone the land is lying down in its own shape again (the world map you walk through is the true one). But land that moves floods, and under the Court's squares lay something Yu never killed, only channelled: Gonggong, the Flood God, who once broke a pillar of heaven with his head.

## Part IX: The Tenth Sun

The magpie bridge holds, and the next morning the sun comes up and does not go down. The Elder tells the oldest story of all: Xihe, Mother of the Ten Suns, drove her children across the sky one a day from the Fusang tree in the Valley of Sunrise, until the morning all ten rose together and the archer Hou Yi shot nine of them down. After that the Heavenly Court drove the last sun and counted the days. With the Court gone the sun kept to its road out of habit, until something frightened it: now it hangs at noon over the scorching east, the west lies in endless night, and the embers of the nine fallen suns are waking in the ground. Only Chang'e, alone in the Moon Palace, still walks the moon round the sky, and she is tiring.

The ending adds the sun and the moon in the sky together, taking turns, with Xihe, Chang'e and the nine new stars of the Dipper.

## Part VIII: The River of Heaven

On the seventh night of the seventh month the whole sect climbs onto the hall roof to watch the magpies gather in the sky, as they have every year. No magpies come. Instead the Silver River across the sky spills over and stars rain into the lotus pond. The Elder tells the old story: the Weaver Star fell in love with a cowherd, and the Queen Mother of the West drew her golden hairpin across the sky to part them. That line became the River of Heaven, the oldest border there is. Qianxian bound its banks with her thread for ten thousand years, and now that she is unpicking her borders the river is pouring down the old Sky Road into the world.

## Part VII: The Unbroken Land

Spring comes, and silver threads appear across the mountain roads overnight. The Elder explains why the world was ever cut into separate realms joined by gates: the Heavenly Court's Weaver, **Madam Qianxian, Lady of a Thousand Threads**, sewed it into a quilt so that each realm could be harvested alone. When Lin Feng turned the Wheel her stitches came undone and the land grew back into one (the open world). Now she is sewing the mortal lands shut again, and spinning the newly reborn into thread, Little Wan among them.

## Part VI: The Turning Wheel

The sky holds, but on the night of the Ghost Festival the lanterns on the lotus pond gather at the sect's south-west gate, and the dead stand among them in a queue that no longer moves. The Heavenly Court did not only prop up the sky with stolen years; it also turned the Wheel of Rebirth, letting souls back up only when the Ledger allowed. With the Court gone the Wheel has stopped, and the overflow of the dead is walking back up the old funeral road. The Elder finally tells Lin Feng where he found him: under a maple in that gorge, beside two nameless graves.

## Bugs found and fixed

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **"The The Thousand Children call you Friend."** The toast, the timeline and the gift screen put "The" in front of a people's name, and two peoples' names (the Thousand Children of Landfall, the Immortals of the Isles) already begin with it | `Game.the_race` adds "The" only where the name has none |
| **The bot chased beasts that run away.** Under-levelled in a region whose packs were all two realms below Lin Feng, its grind walked from pack to pack watching each scatter before his aura (a pack that scatters teaches nothing), and its meditation broke off whenever one came back; at the Eight Gates, where the old regions' beasts all scatter, it could never have levelled | Grinding (and the wait for packs to return) counts only packs that will stand and fight |
| **The ending was hard to look at.** Every release had added its finale to the same frame: thirteen chapters of set pieces within twenty metres of the hero under a camera six metres away (one of the Jianmu's predecessors, a pillar of heaven, a winged Hundun and the gates all stood behind the characters' heads), a yellow lotus with dark lily pads across the foreground, seven lines of text on the brightest part of the sky with no backing, and the results box over the characters' feet | The ending is a short film: each set piece has its own place and its own shot, subtitles sit on a shaded band between letterbox bars, and the results are laid out on a panel beside the two of them (see [What changed](#what-changed-in-this-release)) |
| **The bot meditated for hours at the sect when it needed a stage.** Back at the sect (or on the mountain, or upstairs) when the quest wanted more cultivation, it sat down and meditated rather than go where there was something to fight; after the Conclave the last tribulation wants cultivation full, and it stalled for 45 game-minutes | It goes back to the region of the quest or trial ahead (or, for a breakthrough, the latest region on the quest with foes that will fight) |

### Bugs fixed in the Part XII release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Nobody ever bowed.** Townsfolk were meant to greet the hero with the cultivator's salute when he walked up, but the bow was started on the world clock while each person is animated on a clock of their own (offset by their tile, `t + e.pos.x`), so it began hundreds of seconds in the past and was dropped unplayed | The gesture is started on the model's own clock; the cutscene gestures use the same rule |
| **Any action a model had no clip for played its attack.** `Assets.animate` fell back on the attack clip for everything but `die` and `bow`, so a gesture on an older or a monster model would have swung a sword at whoever was talking | Only battle actions (cast, hurt, victory) fall back on the attack; anything else is skipped |
| **The bot could meditate for hours instead of fighting.** Under-levelled for a boss in the higher realms, its grind fell back on meditation (57 cultivation a second at Mountain-River Oneness, against 705,000 for the stage) whenever no pack was within 60 steps, and only stopped when the stage was reached; it stalled in Juntian for 45 game-minutes in testing | The grind walks to the nearest pack anywhere in the region (leaving an upper storey or cellar first) and leaves meditation as soon as the party is fit and a pack is back |
| **The status panel's attack, defence and speed** were worked out from the level and tempering alone, leaving out the Daos and the peoples' boons (and now the root) | It shows the numbers the battle uses (`Game.fighter`) |
| The bot's fifteen-hour `max_time` would have stopped a game of 14 h 7 min near its end | Seventeen hours |

### Bugs fixed in the Part XI release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **The tests passed while a script did not compile.** `tests/run_tests.gd` runs in `_init()`, before the autoloads exist, so it never compiled the screens that use `Game` (`main.gd`, `battle.gd`, `ending.gd` and the rest); a type that could not be inferred in a new line of `ending.gd` passed every test, and the keyboard smoke test printed the parse error and passed too, while the game made its ending screen without a script | On its first frame, once the autoloads are up, the test runner compiles every script in `scripts/` and `tests/` and fails on any that does not compile; checked by putting the error back |
| **Everyone indoors stood about 0.3 m deep in the floor.** A building's floor is a plank platform 0.31 m above the ground under its middle (`Architecture.house`), but the hero, Yue Ling and the people inside were all placed at the height of the ground under their own tile | `World._stand_y`: indoors, people stand on the planks (and upstairs on the upper storey's) |
| **Battle messages were cut off mid-word in 36 of the 45 regions.** The battle log drew each message on one 440-pixel line, and "Enemies appear!" with three monster names ran past it (up to 759 pixels: "Frost Hare of the Moon, Three-Legged Moon Toad, Silver Crane of the Long Night"); three monster names were also wider than their 200-pixel labels | A long message wraps onto more rows of the log, which shows the newest five; names and boss banners shrink to fit, and a name that would run into its neighbour's moves down a row; a test measures every name with the game's font |
| The bot's twelve-hour `max_time` would have stopped a game of 12 h 46 min before its end | Fifteen hours |

### Bugs fixed in the Part X release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Trails broke through the walls of houses.** `MapGen._carve` joined anything cut off by a greedy random walk towards the target that turned whatever it stepped on into path, building walls included; once a region's open ground stopped being its whole map, the Tea House of the Nine Terraces, the Silkworm House, the Cowherd's Ferry House and the Sleepless Inn each lost wall tiles | A trail is the cheapest way across a cost grid (open ground cheap, forest and water dear, a little noise so it still wanders) where buildings and the map's edge cannot be crossed; the "walls all round except the door" test covers every building |
| **The bot could meditate for ever in a region it had reached**: it counted itself "in" a region as soon as it crossed the border, and looked for monsters only within 64 steps; in the new world, borders lie well outside a region's open ground, so at the Blood Moon Palace every pack was out of reach and it waited 45 game-minutes for a "respawn" | If nothing is close, the bot walks to the nearest pack anywhere in the region, and the respawn wait ends when any pack of the region is back |
| **Buildings in a mirrored region would have stood at the wrong end of it**: a building's rectangle was moved into the world by its top-left corner (`Rect2i(to_world(position), size)`), which on a flipped map is the top-right corner (no flipped region happened to have a building) | `Atlas.rect_to_world` maps both corners; needed now that maps are turned to face their road |
| **Techniques ran off the pause menu**: the list had four fixed columns of seven (28 places), and Lin Feng knows 30 techniques by the end of Part IX, so the last two were drawn past the right edge of the panel | Four columns with as many rows as the list needs; Part X brings it to 33 |
| **Long objectives were cut off mid-sentence**: the HUD drew the objective on one 480-pixel line, and 40 of the 344 quest objectives are longer (up to 770 pixels: "Follow the east road onto the Scorched Millet Plains and find Old Farmer Tian at the shrine of Hou Ji") | Objectives that do not fit wrap onto a second line in place of the heading |
| `Game.tile`, a world tile, was set to the sect's own tile (20, 8) by `reset()` and `respawn()`, a spot in the north-west sea of the new world | The sect's courtyard in world tiles |
| The Nomad Matriarch had only two things to say (every other townsperson has three) | A third line, and a test that every townsperson has three |
| Nothing checked that dialogue fits the dialogue box (four lines); one new line of Part X ran to five | A test measures every line of dialogue and chat with the game's font; the long line was split |
| **Two of this README's diagrams did not render on GitHub**: the big gameplay flowchart had an extra `end` after Part VIII's subgraph, and the open-world release's flowchart had `house():` unquoted inside a node label; Mermaid rejects both | Fixed; every Mermaid block in this README was checked with Mermaid's own parser (11.4) for this release |

### Bugs fixed in the Part IX release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Every exported clip ran a quarter too slow.** `kit.bake_action` keys a pose every 1/30 s on consecutive frames, but Blender's factory scene runs at 24 frames per second, so a 0.55 s attack lasted 0.69 s and every walk dragged | The scene runs at 30 fps and clips start at 0 s (`kit.reset`, `kit.export`), so loops meet their first frame |
| **Characters walked like pacing camels**: in the walk clip `thigh.L` and `upper_arm.L` were driven by the same `sin(phase)` with the same sign, so each arm swung forward with the leg on its own side | Arms counter-swing, a few frames behind the legs |
| **The hero slid along the road**: he crosses a 2 m tile every 0.16 s (12.5 m/s) on a walk cycle of 0.7 s per stride | A run clip with a flight phase for the hero and Yue Ling |
| **Monsters never moved** in the world: only `idle` was ever played | Packs amble round their spot on walk cycles and turn to face the hero |
| **Fallen fighters shrank away in half a second** | A death clip that holds its last frame; fallen allies stay on the field until raised |
| **Every pond was a set of white-rimmed squares**: corners touching water were forced under the surface and the foam marked every corner that touched land, so shorelines were staircases outlined in white | A smooth water field for shore heights, subdivided shore tiles, foam by real depth |
| **Costumes glowed neon**: ambient light (0.85) plus the sun (1.1) plus a fill light lit every surface at about twice its colour | Actor shading with a reduced ambient term and a key light that keeps a lit surface near its painted colour |
| A white stripe of inner robe ran **from the collar to the hem like an apron**, and the collar stood up the neck like a turtleneck | A wrap-around skirt with a trimmed overlap edge; a V at the throat |
| **Part VIII's four guides were drawn as procedural stand-ins**: `_npc_opts` had no entry for them | Each uses its Blender model; any NPC with a Blender model uses it |
| The bot's ten-hour `max_time` would have stopped a ten-hour game before its end | Twelve hours |
| **Yue Ling ran sideways, and kept running on the spot**: she turned to face the hero while her place is off his shoulder (0.7 m behind, 1.4 m to the side), so she ran about 60 degrees off her path, and "moving" was judged by her distance to him, which is always 1.6 m there | `World.companion_step`: she faces the way she actually moves, runs only while her speed says so (with hysteresis), then looks where the hero looks, and turns to him in a conversation (`--follow` in the tour films it) |
| **Monsters were one colour**: each enemy's single colour tinted almost the whole body (85 to 98% of most models), white bellies and dark stripes came out as light and dark shades of that one hue, and the "secondary" sat only 40 degrees round the colour wheel at the same value | Five-role palettes (below) |

### Bugs fixed in the Part VIII release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **The ending screen was hidden behind a giant tree trunk.** The six floating islands were spread round a full circle (`i * 1.1 + 0.4`), which put one peach-tree island at z = 5, between the camera and the hero | The islands sit on the far half of the sky only |
| **Lotus of Rebirth and Homeward Lantern could not raise the fallen**: the heal only targeted living allies, so a knocked-out Lin Feng stayed down; the bot never tried | Reviving heals (`"revive": true`) reach the fallen and raise them; the bot uses them when an ally is down; regression test |
| Lions, tigers, lynxes, apes, macaques and qilin (**11 enemies**, including the White Tiger boss) were drawn with the **wolf** model | New tiger, ape and qilin models; enemies remapped |
| **Character heads were almost half a metre tall** (two stacked ellipsoids, under five heads to the body) with eyes stuck onto the surface | Sculpted heads at about seven heads to the body, eyes set into sockets |
| Hanging sleeves were **inside out** (black) when a loft's cross-sections ran clockwise | `loft()` detects the winding and flips faces so normals point out; linings are built inside on purpose |
| The post-processing rect set a `size` on top of full-rect anchors, printing a warning on every launch | The anchors size it |
| A defeat message was guarded by `if not quiet or true` (always true) | Removed the dead condition |
| `plate_segments` crashed on per-axis radii; `bake_ao` created an unused random generator | Componentwise radii; removed |
| Exported assets were only checked by playing the game | `art/check_assets.py` validates every GLB in CI |

### Bugs fixed in the open-world release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| The pause-menu **techniques list ran off the right of the panel** once Lin Feng knew more than 21 techniques (three columns of seven) | Four narrower columns of seven |
| The sect's **pagoda stood outside the map** past the east wall, on land the hero could walk across in an open world | It stands on its own blocked footprint on the mountain |
| Map **connection trails were straight L-shaped corridors** cut through forests, the most "squarish" thing in every region | Trails wander on the diagonal (`MapGen._carve`) |
| **Monster groups could spawn inside buildings**, and a trail carved to an indoor NPC could break through a wall | Spawns skip floors under a roof; trails to anything indoors go to the doorstep; clearing round NPCs never removes a wall |
| **Hunt kills were credited to the region the player stood in**, not the one the monsters came from, so a fight just across a border would not count | Kills are credited to the monsters' own region; enemy ids carry their region |
| The water surface stopped at the **square edge of each water tile** | The water plane runs on under the bank, so the shoreline follows the ground |
| The bot's **breadth-first search** would have been far too slow over a whole world | `AStarGrid2D` for routes, a capped search for nearby monsters |

### Bugs fixed in the landscapes release

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Every pond, lake and river was invisible.** The far-ground "skirt" that extends the land to the horizon also lay flat across the whole map at y = -0.05, above the water surface (-0.12), covering it with a sheet of grass | Inside the map the skirt now drops below the deepest pond bed |
| **The image looked misty and slightly blurred**: no anti-aliasing; a bloom with a 0.62 threshold added a blurred copy of most of the frame; a soft-light glow; heavy fog with aerial perspective; film grain and chromatic aberration | 4x MSAA; bloom and glow only on bright highlights; fog at 30% density without aerial perspective; grain and fringing removed |
| The bot could **walk back and forth forever** between two tiles when two monster groups were about equally far away (the "nearest" target swapped with every step); the 45-minute stuck detector would have failed CI | The current target is kept unless another is clearly closer |
| Large trees beside the road could **hide the hero** from the chase camera | Foliage within a few metres of the camera dissolves in a dither pattern |
| Rotated boxes in the mesh builder are scaled along world axes, so rotated walls stretched off the map | Architecture uses axis-aligned extents (documented in `architecture.gd`) |
| The toon ink outline had a fixed model-space width: **thick in close-ups**, thin far away | Outline width scales with view depth |
| `ribbon`/`sheet` in the Blender kit returned nothing, and `recolor` erased the outline-skip flag of thin sheets | Both return their vertices; recolouring keeps the surface flag |

### Bugs fixed in the Part V release


| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| The bot's path-finding treated **portal tiles as walkable**, so a path that brushed past another gate teleported it (it bounced between the sect and the forest forever once a second road ran past the east gate) | Gates other than the goal block the path |
| The bot healed with Dawn Lotus at best and **never used Seal Bloom** | It picks the strongest heal Yue Ling knows |
| **Battle menus had no scrolling**: the late-game technique list (up to 17 entries) ran off the bottom of the screen and the cursor moved onto invisible entries | `UI.menu_list` scrolls with the cursor and shows scroll hints |
| The pause-menu **techniques list** overflowed its two columns of eight | Three columns of seven |
| The **HP and Qi bars** in the world HUD and on the meditation screen covered the numbers once they reached four digits | Bars moved clear of the text |
| **Long boss names** were clipped under their health bars, and party names were drawn underneath the translucent command panels | Wider labels for bosses; party labels removed (the status panel shows them) |
| **Long speaker names** ("Xuan Wu, Black Tortoise of the North") overflowed the dialogue name tag | The tag grows with the name |
| A conversation with **no lines** opened an empty dialogue box that Enter could never close | `say([])` runs its callback directly |
| Starting a **second game** from the title kept the previous run's toasts and NPC chat rotation | Reset in `new_game()` |
| A script error made `tests/run_tests.gd` **hang until CI's 40-minute timeout** instead of failing | A watchdog fails the run on the first frame; the smoke test has a frame limit |

### Bugs fixed in earlier releases

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| Two identical foes (same species, level and HP) were drawn **on top of each other** in battle: `Array.find()` compares dictionaries by value, so both resolved to the same stage slot | Each foe gets an explicit `slot` (`Data.make_foes`); regression test added |
| The sect's **east gate** faced the wrong way (rotation only applied to `x > 40`, but the sect is 40 tiles wide) | Orientation is computed from the map edges |
| Cancelling **Yue Ling's basic attack** target selection opened the Skills menu instead of the main menu | Both basic attacks (`strike`, `needle`) return to the main menu |
| Using a pill from the pause menu at **full HP or Qi** silently wasted it | The pill is kept and a message is shown |
| The **techniques list** in the pause menu overflowed the panel once more than 12 techniques were known | Two columns of eight |
| The **Jade Mantis Matriarch** was drawn as a wolf and the **Eon Tortoise** as a crab | New mantis and tortoise models |
| The bot's default `--max-time` (4 h) would have cut off a longer game | Raised to 6 h |

## Narrative plot holes found and fixed

Nineteen holes found in this release by reading every quest step, conversation and townsperson's chat against the quest order and the world map:

| Plot hole | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Lin Feng gave the Nine Heavens root away** to the Hollow Heaven as a seed in Part III, yet everyone still calls him its bearer, and it goes on waking | Yue Ling sees it at once: a seed that is given is a seed that is planted, and the Hollow's dawn grew one back in him with every branch the old root had woken |
| **The sect's townsfolk talked about the future on the first morning**: stars falling in the pond, saving the sky twice, three demon lords and a Jade Emperor, feeding immortals, a new sweeper with Lin Feng's old broom while Lin Feng was still sweeping | Those lines wait until the story has got there (`Data.CHAT_LATER`); Little Bai takes up the broom when Lin Feng leaves the sect; the others got lines for the beginning |
| Houtu thanks Lin Feng for turning the Wheel "**and then** closing the Ledger": the Ledger closed in Part IV, the Wheel turned in Part VI | The right order |
| **Who holds the sky up?** Part V: Nuwa's pillars (and once the Court's stolen years); Part XI: Chong, for four thousand years | Chong holds heaven *away from the earth*; Nuwa's pillars bear its weight |
| **The Court's age**: ten thousand years by every ledger, but the Moon Palace was kept "since before the Court was built" and the Jianmu stood "before the Court, before Yu" | Chang'e has kept it since the archer's day; the Jianmu stood before Yu |
| The Weaver Star is **"the Jade Emperor's granddaughter"**, and this world's Jade Emperor is the one Lin Feng ended | The Queen Mother's granddaughter, as Xiwangmu herself says |
| The Weaver Star wove the river's banks for **three thousand** years; everybody else counts ten thousand | Ten thousand |
| **Fox-tail arithmetic**: a thousand years for nine tails, a thousand for each, nine hundred, three hundred for three | A thousand years to grow all nine; a one-tailed fox cub at the Gate now complains that nobody will tell him the real sums |
| **The sect's age**: three hundred years, but its Seal was co-forged by an ancestor who "waited three thousand years", its dead lie in a graveyard "a thousand years" old and its chime was "cracked for a thousand years" | Three hundred years throughout |
| **The four pillars are not at the corners of the world**: the "western" pillar is in a desert south-east of the sect | The Elder explains that Nuwa ringed the tear in the sky at the world's south-east edge, so the books' directions are the pillars', not the map's |
| The Moon Palace was **"in the west"** although it lies past Fusang in the far east | Over the top of the sky, into the night |
| Longmen had **three hundred years of boats** but its River Earl took brides for a thousand | A thousand years of boats |
| The sleeping babies of Part VII were **"gone"** in the morning, but their bodies are in their cradles | They would not wake: nobody was home behind the eyes |
| The Naihe Bridge was open **"for the first time in sixteen years"**; the Wheel had only stopped a season before | For the first time since the Wheel stopped |
| The Void Rift lay on the volcano's **eastern** slope (it is west), and the hermit who "knows the Emperor's name" never says it | The western slope; he knows what the Emperor is |
| Gun says Yu **"had his mother's sense"**: in this telling Yu was cut from Gun's own body | "He did not get that from me" |
| **Four Part X guides each forgot a boss** of their region in the briefing (the Stone Lion, Gun's turtle, the white fox, Kuafu) | Each names all five |
| **"Nobody could climb up or down to check"**, although Lin Feng had climbed the Court's stair and walked the sun's road | The Archivist: the Court's stair went to its own door and no further; the Level Heaven is above it |
| The Seal is **"the lotus at your belt"**, three lines before it "slept in Lin Feng's dantian"; Bai Ze's "I told you the Gate had opened for three" pointed back at a line most players never hear; the Needle General's needle was kept and never used | The lotus mark over his dantian; Bai Ze says it in the scene; the needle goes to Weaver Liu to unpick the last threads |

### Plot holes fixed in the Part VII release

| Plot hole | Fix |
|---|---|
| Why did every forest, marsh and desert have **a gate in it**, and why does the world now run on without them? | Part VII: the gates were the Court Weaver's seams; when the Wheel turned they came undone and the land grew back into one |
| The **village midwife** who raised Lin Feng (Part VI) was never seen | Granny Wen is Part VII's first guide, in her own house |
| The finale's **baby girl who knows Lin Feng's face** was left unexplained | Part VII: she is Little Wan, Su Wan reborn; the story turns on bringing her home |

### Plot holes fixed in the Part VI release

| Plot hole | Fix |
|---|---|
| Lin Feng is "an orphaned sect sweeper", but **his parents were never mentioned again** in five parts | Part VI: the Elder found him as a baby beside two nameless graves; his parents, Lin Shan and Su Wan, hid him from Xu Mo's hunters, refused Meng Po's soup for sixteen years to wait for him, and walk on to rebirth in the finale |
| If the Elder found him as a baby, why has he only **swept the steps for three years**? | The Elder left him with the village midwife below the mountain, where no hunter would look for a bearer; he climbed the steps at thirteen |
| Yue Ling "woke beside a lotus pond **three winters ago**", the same winter Lin Feng arrived, with no reason given | The Seal woke her when the bearer came up the mountain |
| The Court's harvest held up the sky (Part V), but **death and rebirth**, which every soul passes through, were never addressed | Part VI: the Court also turned the Wheel of Rebirth; with the Ledger closed it stopped |

### Plot holes fixed in earlier releases


| Plot hole | Fix |
|---|---|
| The Elder asks for **three** Frost Jades but the quest needs four | Elder now says four |
| The **Heaven-Cleaving Sword** was usable from Early Nascent Soul, before Ancestor Jian Wuchen teaches it | Technique is gated on beating the Thunder Roc (`after` field) and covered by a test |
| The Elder demands the **Roc's feather** that the player is never given | The Roc now drops a feather item, mentioned in dialogue |
| The Dragon King gives a **pearl "as proof"** that never exists, and greets Lin Feng as if they had met ("how you have grown") | He gives a Dragon King's Scale which Sage Huo Rong recognises; the greeting no longer implies a past meeting |
| Sage **Chi Rong** and the villain **Chi Yan** shared a surname with no relation | Sage renamed Huo Rong |
| Xu Mo "hunted you for **three centuries**" although Lin Feng is a teenager | Reframed as hunting the *root's* bearers, and resolved by Part III (Lin Feng is the twentieth bearer) |
| Marsh Hag called Lin Feng the **seal's bearer**; everyone else says root bearer | Unified to "bearer of the Nine Heavens root" |
| Iron Fang jeers at a **"sweeper boy"** he could not know about | Now a "sect boy" |
| The **Jade Mantis** hunt had no in-story motivation | The Elder's briefing mentions the mantis claiming the herb groves |
| Alchemist says "take these pills" but gives none | Now "take this payment" |
| Yue Ling's origin (a random healer who happens to be bound nearby) had no foreshadowing | She wakes beside a lotus pond three winters ago; paid off in Part III |
| Sage Huo Rong lists three fire bosses but there are four; the hermit says "three who shepherd" the horrors but there are four; the Gatekeeper lists the wrong guardians | Counts and lists corrected |
| Quest items (pearls, embers, star fragments) were collected and never used | Each is now referenced in the following dialogue |
| The **sect storyline was abandoned**: the failing Seal, the Elder and Xu Mo's army were never resolved and the game ended in a distant gate | Part III returns Lin Feng to the sect and resolves the Seal, the Elder, Yue Ling and the Emperor |

## Architecture

Game logic (`game.gd`, `data.gd`, `mapgen.gd`, the battle rules and the bot) is unchanged by the 3D port; only the presentation layer is new. Screens derive from `ScreenBase` (`screen.gd`): each owns an optional `Node3D` scene plus a 2D overlay drawn with the UI helpers.

Highlights of the renderer: merged vertex-coloured meshes (a few draw calls per chunk) whose vertex alpha selects a procedural surface texture in the toon shader, an inverted-hull ink outline (skipped for thin double-sided geometry), MultiMesh instancing for landmarks, boulders, decorations and grass, a height-field terrain with a per-region ground shader, animated water/lava with foam, a sky shader per region, two-layer weather (snow, rain, petals, embers, bubbles, void stars, sand, clouds, lanterns, sparks, plus fireflies, pollen, ash or haze), rigged characters and monsters, and element-specific spell effects.

The screenshot tour also renders model galleries (`--gallery`).

Regenerate screenshots (needs a GL context; use `xvfb-run` on a server):

```sh
godot --path . --fixed-fps 30 -- --tour=docs/screenshots              # everything

```

## The playthrough bot

`scripts/bot.gd` plays the entire game end to end through the **same input surface a human uses** (`up/down/confirm/cancel` presses on the top screen and a held movement direction). It pathfinds across the open world with `AStarGrid2D` (seals still closed and other monsters count as blocked), grinds and meditates when under-levelled, rests when hurt, shops, picks skills by elemental weakness, heals with pills or Spring Rain, and handles tribulations. Since Part XII it also wakes the branches of the Nine Heavens root by a plan, opens the Founder's caves it passes once its realm allows, and when it must grind in the higher realms it goes looking for packs anywhere in the region rather than meditate for hours. Since Part XIII it **prepares for every trial** by a plan that takes each one a different way (`TRIAL_PLAN`: craft, respect, wealth, might, the Dao, a relic) and falls back on the cheapest feasible way: it hunts the essences a recipe needs, crafts at the cauldron or the forge, earns stones, does deeds for renown (nearest first), fetches keepsakes from upper storeys and cellars, changes Daos at a stele, tempers its sword, and opens the Eight Gates in the order of `GATE_PLAN`; `--route=sword|peoples|cauldron` picks its road into the heart (the default is the Many Peoples).

To make its clock a fair estimate of a person's playtime it uses human-scale pacing: 0.2 to 0.4 s per key press, and each dialogue line is "read" for about `length / 40` seconds after it finishes typing.

```sh
godot --headless --fixed-fps 30 --path . -- --bot --seed=1234 --report=build/bot_report.json
```

**Is the game sped up?** No. `--fixed-fps 30` makes each frame advance the game clock by exactly 1/30 s regardless of how fast the machine renders it. All movement, typing, battle animation and meditation run off that same frame time, so a full hour of *game time* is simulated in under a minute of *wall-clock* time. `Game.playtime` is the game clock, and it is the number reported. Drop `--fixed-fps` (and optionally pass `--timescale=N`) to watch the bot in real time.

Latest result (seed 1234, identical across runs). The last release took 14:06:51. The same bot now reaches the end of Part XII at 15:13:53: the trials of the old chapters (crafting trips back to the sect, deeds for renown, Daos changed at the steles, harder battles and the rests they need) add **1 hour 7 minutes**, and Part XIII itself plays in about **49 minutes**: the game is now **1 hour 56 minutes longer**. It passes 30 trials (craft 9, respect 5, wealth 5, might 5, dao 4, relic 1, peoples 1), crafts 9 things, does 8 deeds, opens 4 of the Eight Gates and reaches the heart by the Road of the Many Peoples. The other two roads were played to the ending from `--bot-start=s_p13_heart`: the Road of the Sword in 0:45:25 and the Road of the Cauldron in 0:43:38 of game time.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) downloads Godot, imports the project, runs the data-integrity tests (`tests/run_tests.gd`: quest/dialogue/NPC/boss references, gate symmetry, map reachability and determinism, the open world (everything reachable, seals closing every unopened region, determinism), every building's walls and door, every 3D model and terrain builds, story consistency, the realms, floors, Daos and peoples, the Eastern Sea, realm suppression, the nine branches of the root and the Founder's caves, cutscene gestures and progress-aware chat, every trial and its ways, the recipes and where their ingredients come from, the deeds, renown, the Eight Gates and the three roads, and that every script compiles), then runs the bot headless and **fails the build if the game is not completed or takes less than 15 hours of game time**. A second job installs Blender as a Python module, rebuilds every asset in `art/` from its script and validates the exports with `art/check_assets.py`. The bot report is uploaded as an artifact and shown in the job summary.
